en,the buxton line is a railway line in northern england connecting manchester with buxton in derbyshire passenger services on the line are currently operated by northern history it has its origins with the stockport disley and whaley bridge railway which the lnwr built to connect with the cromford and high peak railway at whaley bridge in it built an extension from whaley bridge via chapel en le frith to buxton this forestalled the manchester sheffield and lincolnshire railway s plans for the area and also the midland railway s attempts to reach manchester the latter two railways were forced to combine forces in a line following the lnwr but north of it through new mills part of what is now known as the hope valley line branching at millers dale as a result buxton one of the largest towns in the peak never achieved main line status the lnwr had offered the use of the line but with its climb through dove holes the midland did not consider it useful for express trains saying that it went up a steep hill merely for the sake of going down the lnwr may have saved costs in construction but it proved difficult to operate even with the powerful locomotives they had been forced to introduce for their lines north of manchester in later days a seventeen mile stretch was operated using banking engines the longest such section on the british railway system in there was a serious accident at chapel en le frith in which driver john axon who died at his post attempting to control a runaway goods train received the george cross medal the beeching cuts threatened closure but the line was reprieved at a hearing in in its accounts british rail counted the cost of the reprieve at m at prices in a full year plus which could have been saved if freight was also withdrawn the line was electrified at kv ac overhead between manchester and hazel grove in colour light signalling controlled from lnwr built boxes at edgeley junction and hazel grove cover the line as far as norbury crossing which itself has a small hut controlling two semaphore signals in the middlewood area farther south signalling is mostly semaphore and is controlled from signal boxes at furness vale chapel en le frith and buxton present day services over the section between manchester and hazel grove there are four trains per hour in each direction with extra services at peak hours the manchester to buxton service runs hourly combining with an hourly daytime only manchester piccadilly to hazel grove service to give davenport woodsmoor and hazel grove stations a half hourly off peak service to and from manchester the latter service now runs to from blackpool north via bolton replacing the former hourly service between buxton and blackpool north that ran until december only one blackpool north buxton service still operates but most of those from hazel grove were extended through from preston in october to replace the service from liverpool lime street that had gone over to electric operation south of hazel grove the off peak pattern is hourly the hourly liverpool to norwich east midlands trains manchester airport to cleethorpes transpennine express services run over the edgeley to hazel grove section but only one emt service calls at hazel grove on weekday mornings all others being non stop between stockport and sheffield due to steep gradients on this line class and class dmus are banned from the section of line between hazel grove and buxton therefore services to buxton are worked by class and class dmus also class dmus were once blocked from operating on the line to buxton due to the possibility of the large roof mounted air vents striking low bridges on the route piccadilly to hazel grove services used class electric multiple units up until one service a day continued to operate on the line from december until december but since then all services have been diesel worked from october services on the buxton branch were in the hands of class diesel units

late october the team began practicing every evening at p m all students who were strong enough for the game were again reminded to come out and practice with the team the team s schedule was established based on challenges between teams the michigan team received challenges from notre dame the harvard school of chicago the detroit athletic club and albion college in the end only three games were scheduled the first on november and the last on november the last game was set for thanksgiving day in hopes that the game would attract a large crowd and develop a tradition to rival the thanksgiving day games played before large crowds in new york at detroit athletic club michigan played its first game of the year on november in detroit the opponent was the football team from the detroit athletic club and the game was played at the club s grounds as one of the earliest exhibitions of football in detroit the game attracted considerable interest and curiosity the detroit free press emphasized the unfamiliarity of the game in its coverage the spectacle of twenty muscular young men in one colossal heap struggling pulling hauling pushing with arms legs and caps flying in every direction is an exciting and certainly novel one all the ground and lofty tumbling was for the possession of a leather covered foot ball which every one of those twenty two athletes had evidently determined to possess or perish in the attempt while one unaccustomed to foot ball will naturally be startled by some of the acrobatic feats still it is impossible to watch the game for any length of time without a tingling of the blood and holding of the breath it is most intensely exciting continuous in action and replete with fine points of play the teams took to the field at p m and the game began at p m the free press described the athletic grounds as a gay scene with young men scampering over the field in picturesque suits consisting of close fitting knitted caps of gay colors canvas jackets and knickerbockers stockings of various colors and shoes of all kind on the opening play of the game michigan s team captain james e duffy who had set the world s record for dropkick distance in lined up for the kick off but michigan halfback edgar mcpherran grabbed the ball on a pre arranged trick play and ran downfield duffy followed with a long run from scrimmage michigan scored eight points in the first half of minutes the points came on a touchdown and goal after touchdown both scored by duffy and a safety in the second half michigan end james van inwagen added a touchdown for michigan the game ended early due to darkness although michigan records reflect the final score as a victory the account of the game in the detroit free press indicated that the score was when the game was postponed due to darkness the team sent to detroit consisted of van inwagen right end bradley right tackle hagle right guard malley center beach left guard northcroft left tackle smith left end farrand quarterback mcpherran halfback duffy halfback and ball goal depont and payne were the substitutes the umpire was frederick william mehlhop and the referee was michigan student george p codd albion michigan played its only home game against albion college at the ann arbor fairgrounds on november michigan won by a score of michigan s points established a wolverines single game scoring record that was not exceeded until fielding h yost s point a minute team scored points against buffalo albion s four points were awarded after the visitors disputed a call made by the officials and threatened to leave the grounds the albion players were persuaded to continue with the game upon a concession of four points by the home team the detroit free press called it a splendid game with some excellent team work being done by the varsity eleven the chronicle wrote as usual u of m had a walk away albion scored her first point through an error michigan s lineup against albion was van inwagen right end bradley right tackle malley right guard hagle center beach left guard payne left tackle macmillan left end f l smith quarterback mcpherran halfback j e duffy halfback and ball goal at chicago university club michigan concluded its season with a thanksgiving day game against the chicago university club the game was played at the chicago baseball park the home field of cap anson s chicago whitestockings it was attended by persons and the proceeds totaling approximately were given to charities including the geneva fresh air fund the lake side sanitarium and the training school for nurses a inch high silver cup valued at was presented to the winning team the new york times and outing magazine both called it undoubtedly the greatest football event that ever took place in the west football was new to chicago and the chicago daily tribune therefore published a lengthy summary of the game s rules jargon and methods on the day before the game the tribune described prize fighting as a mild sport in comparison to football in a football game a player who gets possession of the ball may be attacked by anywhere form one to eleven men slugging is not allowed but tackling is a tackle as described below is a delightful and exciting point of play the man who is tackled if game will endeavor to hold the ball while the members of both teams will try to form a mountain on top of him the michigan team arrived in chicago at p m on friday evening and stayed at the palmer house after eating supper at the hotel the team attended a performance of francis chassaigne s nadjy at the chicago opera house the chicago university club team was a picked team selected from the best athletes in the west many of whom had played college football for yale princeton harvard or columbia chicago s center peters and left guard burke were well known former college players who were brought in from st paul and nebraska the new york times wrote that the preparatory schools and the universities had been drained for the best talent in sight the chicago daily tribune wrote that the chicago team represented the best men that could be collected from university men resident west of the alleghenies the game attracted many representatives of chicago s high society the chicago daily tribune wrote the finest turnouts of the city with the leaders of chicago beauty decked in and favorite college colors swept into the grounds four in hands tally hos english carts mail phaetons carriages and all sorts of fashionable vehicles their occupants did not know much about football and did not entirely approve of the rough and gory sport a bugle on a tally ho belonging to chicago quarterback harry hamlin announced the arrival of the chicago team at the playing field early in the contest michigan s starting center horace greely prettyman was ejected for slugging chicago s center peters the new york times wrote prettyman lost his temper and struck peters in the mouth twice with his fist the chronicle offered a defense of prettyman the facts in the case are that prettyman knocked loose the hands of peters when peters had grabbed him by the jacket peters declared that prettyman had not hit him on the jaw but the umpire a yale man knew more than the man who was struck the new york times called prettyman the backbone of the michigan rush line and noted that the team was disheartened after his ejection peters the player who prettyman hit was described as the giant of the chicago men the detroit free press described the difficulties that the michigan team had in handling peters after prettyman was ejected two or three men went for him and were hurled from his shoulders like boys tossed by a long horned texas steer and clearing the mob he knocked down the last remaining opponent and scored a touch down the chicago team took an lead at halftime according to the chicago daily tribune the halftime intermission allowed the players to count bruises the tribune emphasized the physical nature of the battle not a man on either team had escaped blood noses were bleeding profusely every man s lips were cut and swollen faces were plastered with mud and lame joints and twitching backs were many in the second half michigan halfback and captain james e duffy scored michigan s only touchdown by good running and dodging duffy was singled out for praise the new york times wrote that duffy played with wonderful skill and noted that many observers thought that duffy s play was the chief feature of the game duffy scored a second touchdown on a long run but the umpire samuel davis capen ruled that duffy had been offside and disallowed the touchdown the ruling was disputed and even the chicago daily tribune wrote that the score should have been allowed after the game one michigan player complained about the officiating those yale men capen was a yale graduate are always ferocious but we don t object to rough treatment what we didn t like was that our men were ruled off for slugging while they could slug as much as they pleased michigan s captain duffy added the only thing that i regret is that we feel that the umpire was unfair disqualifying prettyman disheartened us he was our mainstay we have learned that football consists much more in little tricks incessantly played than in plain fair play the chronicle emphasized that the chicago team treated the michigan team most royally and acted as perfect gentlemen but complained tis lamentable that as much can not be said of the fairness of the umpire the chronicle also opined that despite the loss the michigan team was well trained and probably as thoroughly disciplined as any the university has had for some years michigan s starting lineup on thanksgiving day was van inwagen right end bradley right tackle malley right guard prettyman center beach left guard hagle left tackle macmillan left end f l smith quarterback mcpherran halfback j e duffy halfback and w d ball goal the game drew more extensive coverage in the press than any previous football game in the west the chronicle expressed the hope that the game would spark interest in football in the west and opined that the fever may now be said to be upon us the chicago times covered the thanksgiving day game on the front page and relegated the yale princeton game to page two players varsity letter

en,hongi hika c march was a new zealand m ori rangatira chief and war leader of the ng puhi iwi tribe hongi hika used european weapons to overrun much of northern new zealand in the first of the musket wars he also encouraged p keh european settlement patronised new zealand s first missionaries introduced m ori to western agriculture and helped put the m ori language into writing he travelled to england and met king george iv hongi hika s military campaigns and the other musket wars were one of the most important stimuli for the british annexation of new zealand and subsequent treaty of waitangi with ng puhi and many other iwi he was a pivotal figure in the period when m ori history emerged from myth and oral tradition and p keh began to settle rather than just visit born hongi hika was born at kaikohe into a chiefly family of the te uri o hua hap subtribe of ng puhi his mother was tuhikura a ng ti kahu woman from whangaroa his father was te h tete son of auha who with his brother whakaaria had expanded ng puhi s territory from the kaikohe area into the bay of islands area hongi hika once said he was born in the year explorer marion du fresne was killed by m ori in though other sources place his birth around early campaigns hongi hika rose to prominence as a military leader in the ng puhi campaign led by pokaia against the te roroa hapu of ng ti wh tua iwi in in over years since the maori first begun sporadic contact with europeans firearms had not entered into widespread use ng puhi fought with small numbers of them in and hongi hika was present later that same year on the first occasion that muskets were used in action by m ori this was at the battle of moremonui at which the ng puhi were defeated the ng puhi were overrun by the opposing ng ti wh tua while reloading those killed included two of hongi hika s brothers and pokaia and hongi hika and other survivors only escaped by hiding in a swamp until ng ti wh tua called off the pursuit to avoid provoking utu hongi hika became the war leader of the ng puhi his warriors included te ruki kawiti mataroria moka te kainga mataa rewa ruatara paraoa motiti hewa and mahanga in he led a large taua war party to the hokianga against ng ti pou despite his earlier experiences he seems to have become convinced of the value of muskets which were used during this campaign in hongi avenged the earlier defeat of moremonui in the battle of te ika a ranganui although both sides suffered heavy losses contact with europeans and journey to australia ng puhi controlled the bay of islands the first point of contact for most europeans visiting new zealand in the early th century hongi hika protected early missionaries and european seamen and settlers arguing the benefits of trade he befriended thomas kendall one of three lay preachers sent by the church missionary society to establish a christian toehold in new zealand in hongi hika and his nephew ruatara the then leader of the ng puhi visited sydney australia with kendall and met the local head of the church missionary society samuel marsden ruatara and hongi hika invited marsden to establish the first anglican mission to new zealand in ng puhi territory ruatara died the following year leaving hongi hika as protector of the mission in hongi led a war party to thames where he attacked the ngati maru stronghold of te totara killing and taking prisoners on july he granted acres of land at kerikeri to the church missionary society in return for felling axes land which became known as the society s plains he personally assisted the missionaries in developing a written form of the m ori language hongi hika never converted to christianity in later life in exasperation with teachings of humility and non violence he described christianity as a religion fit only for slaves he protected the p keh m ori thomas kendall when he effectively went native taking a m ori wife and participating in m ori religious ceremonies though hongi hika encouraged the first missions to new zealand virtually no m ori converted to christianity for a decade large scale conversion of northern m ori only occurred after his death while in australia hongi hika studied european military and agricultural techniques and purchased muskets and ammunition from he introduced european agricultural implements and the potato using slave labour to produce crops for trade wives hongi married turikatuku who was an important military advisor for him although she went blind early in their marriage he later took her sister tangiwhare as additional wife both bore at least one son and daughter by him it is uncertain if he had other wives bay of plenty campaign in hongi hika led one of two ng puhi taua against east cape and bay of plenty iwi ng ti porou and ngaiterangi the taua returned in carrying nearly captured slaves journey to england in hongi hika and thomas kendall travelled to england on board the whaling ship new zealander he spent months in london and cambridge where his facial tattoos made him something of a sensation during the trip he met king george iv who presented him with a suit of armour he continued his linguistic work assisting professor samuel lee who was writing the first m ori english dictionary written m ori maintains a northern feel to this day as a result for example the sound usually pronounced f in m ori is written wh because of hongi hika s soft aspirated northern dialect campaigns against ng ti wh tua waikato and rotorua hongi hika returned to the bay of islands in july after days away via sydney australia hongi hika waikato and kendall travelled to new south wales aboard speke which was transporting convicts there the three travellers then went on to the bay of islands aboard westmoreland arriving on july at sydney hongi hika picked up an estimated muskets that were waiting for him the muskets had been ordered by baron charles de thierry whom hongi met at cambridge england de theirry traded the muskets for land in the hokianga although de theirry s claim to the land was later disputed hongi was able to uplift the guns without them being paid for he also had a large quantity of gunpowder ball ammunition swords and daggers using these within months of his return he led his warriors against those of the ng ti p oa chief te hinaki which resulted in the death of hinaki around of his warriors at moaki he then led a force of about men to attack a pa m ori fort at panmure on the tamaki river killing warriors and their women and children in retribution for a previous defeat deaths in this one action during the intertribal musket wars outnumber all deaths in years of the sporadic new zealand wars in early he led his force up the waikato river where after initial success he was defeated by te wherowhero before gaining another victory at orongokoekoea te wherowhero ambushed the ng puhi carrying ng ti mahuta women captives and freed them in he made peace with the waikato iwi and invaded te arawa territory in rotorua in hongi hika attacked ng ti wh tua again losing men including his eldest son hare hongi in the battle of te ika a ranganui according to some accounts ng ti wh tua lost men although hongi hika himself downplaying the tragedy put the number at in any event the defeat was a catastrophe for ng ti wh tua the survivors retreated south they left behind the fertile region of t maki makaurau the auckland isthmus with its vast natural harbours at waitemat and manukau land which had belonged to ng ti wh tua since they won it by conquest over a hundred years before hongi hika left t maki makaurau almost uninhabited as a southern buffer zone fifteen years later when lt governor william hobson wished to remove his fledging colonial administration from settler and ng puhi influence in the bay of islands he was able to purchase this land cheaply from ng ti wh tua to build auckland a settlement that has become new zealand s principal city although m ori population had always been to some extent mobile in the face of conquests of land during the musket wars hongi hika altered the balance of power not only in the waitemata but also the bay of plenty tauranga coromandel rotorua and waikato to an extent which seems unprecedented within the memory of his contemporaries although he did not usually occupy conquered territory his campaigns and those of other musket warriors triggered a series of migrations claims and counter claims which in the late th century would add to the disputes over land sales in the waitangi tribunal not least ng ti wh tua s occupation of bastion point waimate to whangaroa in hongi hika moved from waimate to conquer whangaroa and found a new settlement in part this was to punish ng ti uru and ng ti pou and gain control of millable kauri on january a party of his warriors without his knowledge ransacked wesleydale the wesleyan mission and it was abandoned injury and death in january hongi hika was shot in the chest by maratea during a minor engagement in the hokianga he invited those around him to listen to the wind whistle through his lungs and some claimed to have been able to see completely through him hongi hika lingered for months before dying of infection from this wound on march at whangaroa hongi hika s death appears to be a turning point in m ori society in contrast to the traditional conduct that followed the death of an important rangatira chief no attack was made by neighbouring tribes by way of muru attack made in respect of the death of hongi hika on his death bed hongi hika spoke against sacrifices being made following his death f e manning s later published account has hika warning that if the red coat soldiers should land in aotearoa when you see them make war against them james stack wesleyan missionary at whangaroa records a conversation with eruera maihi patuone on march the report of that conversation is that hongi hika exhorted his followers to oppose against any force that came against them and that hongi hika s dying words were no matter from what quarter your enemies come let their number be ever so great should they come there hungry for you kia toa kia toa be brave be brave thus will you revenge my death and this only do i wish to be revenged hongi hika was survived by children legacy the extent of hongi hika s plans and ambitions are unknown although he said during his visit to england there is only one king in england there shall be only one king in new zealand this is likely bravado in m ori lacked a national identity seeing themselves as belonging to separate iwi it would be years before waikato iwi recognised a m ori king that king was te wherowhero a man who built his mana defending the waikato against hongi hika hongi hika never attempted to establish any form of long term government over iwi he conquered and most often did not attempt to permanently occupy territory it is likely his aims were opportunistic based on increasing the mana m ori accorded to great warriors hongi hika is mostly remembered as a warrior and leader during the musket wars history has generally attributed hongi hika s military success to his acquisition of muskets comparing his military skills poorly with the other major m ori war leader of the period te rauparaha however hongi hika had the foresight to acquire european weapons and evolve the design of the m ori war p and m ori warfare tactics something which was a nasty surprise to british and colonial forces in later years during hone heke s rebellion in hongi hika s military conquests may not have endured but his importance lies not only in his campaigns and the social upheaval they caused but also his encouragement of early european settlement agricultural improvements and the development of a written version of m ori frederick edward maning a p keh m ori who lived at hokianga wrote a near contemporaneous account of hongi hika in a history of the war in the north of new zealand against the chief heke its accuracy is questioned on the basis that it was written with an aim to entertain rather than with an eye to historical accuracy in this book manning published an account of the death bed speech of hongi hika which account which is attributed to a ng puhi chief the account has hongi hika saying children and friends pay attention to my last words after i am gone be kind to the missionaries be kind also to the other europeans welcome them to the shore trade with them protect them and live with them as one people but if there should land on this shore a people who wear red garments who do no work who neither buy or sell and who always have arms in their hands then be aware that these are people called soldiers a dangerous people whose only occupation is war when you see them make war against them then o my children be brave then o my friends be strong be brave that you may not be enslaved and that your country may not

en,hero is a lambda winning novel and the only novel by openly gay film producer and novelist perry moore the fantasy novel is about a teenage superhero thom creed who must deal with his ex superhero father s disgrace his own sexuality and a murderer stalking the world s heroes plot summary thom creed is a year old high school basketball star who has a tendency to get into trouble his mother abandoned the family several years ago and his father hal a publicly disgraced ex superhero is now a lowly factory worker thom is filled with teen aged angst because he is gay and knows that his father greatly disapproves of homosexuality he becomes a tutor for children with reading and language disorders at the community center and often reads to his students after an incident during a reading session he is moved to another class where he meets a young man named goran thom mistakes goran for a student because of his strong accent accidentally offending him it turns out that actually goran is the person who started the reading program a few years before during a basketball game thom recognizes one of the players from the opposing team as goran thom is thrown off his game and goran ends up breaking one of his legs strangely thom heals goran s injury by touching his leg over the compound fracture he has healed others before but does not fully understand his ability apparently no one notices what he has done for goran and when the game resumes another player calls thom a faggot in front of everyone afterwards thom has a seizure which is most likely related to stress created by absorbing goran s injuries and his fears about his father discovering his sexual orientation while recuperating at the hospital he is forced to give up his driver s license and must resort to using the bus to get around during the summer thom s coach kicks him off the team due to his medical issues though thom gets the coach to confess that it is actually because of the comment made during the game when he gets home he takes his father s laptop and decides to look at porn thom explains that he is afraid to come out not only because of his father but due to living in a homophobic town while masturbating to a picture of local superhero uberman hal comes home to get ready for his real estate class thom quickly straightens things up but doesn t have enough time to erase his history on the computer when his father does leave thom decides to run away from home when he falls asleep on the bus he becomes mixed up in a battle between some villains and the league he also encounters a mysterious man known as dark hero who works alone thom ends up using his powers yet again on a young mother and gets an invitation to try out for one the minor leagues when he gets home he discovers that hal s former mentor captain victory has died he decides not to tell his father about the tryouts because hal harbors intense resentment for the league thom is accepted as a trainee and assigned to work with a group of other probationary heroes the group consists of ruth an aging psychic scarlett who can control heat and larry who has the ability to give others any disease the stress of keeping so many secrets from his father exacts a painful toll soon however the world s superheroes begin dying under mysterious circumstances in order to solve the mystery thom must reunite with his fellow outcast trainees and deal as well with society s prejudices when his secrets are revealed genesis and future books moore said he wrote the book after being upset by a marvel comic in the enemy of the state storyline the gay character northstar is killed by wolverine while the latter is brainwashed by the hand moore believed that having one of marvel s biggest superheroes murder its most prominent gay character sent the wrong message to readers moore subsequently created a list of lgbtq superheroes who have met with torture rape disembowelment decapitation had their genitalia disfigured or removed or retconned as heterosexual his growing awareness of the poor treatment of glbtq superhero characters led him to write hero to present a more positive side critical reception reviews of hero have been mainly positive people magazine was unequivocal in its praise for the book it called the novel compelling funny and touching and the characters enigmatic the times london review on the publication of the uk edition was also largely positive thom is devoid of the grossly stereotypical attributes that comic books link to their gay characters sexual preference and the book is entertaining though in contrast to its rich core tackling deep social issues the writing is light the advocate similarly equivocated in its praise the gay newsmagazine applauded moore s original superhero characters and moore s decision to avoid making thom creed an outcast the review also pointed to wittily written descriptions of thom masturbating to internet porn coming out to his father and his first kiss but otherwise his play by play writing style can seem a bit choppy especially in the story s more poignant moments the review noted nevertheless hero is a quick at times shallow but satisfying novel the kind we all wanted while growing up and hopefully the first in a new genre of young adult literature in a very brief review entertainment weekly called the book pulpy but with good punch and rated it an a minus publishers weekly applauded the book for its subject matter and for expanding the genre of gay literature into superhero fantasy but ultimately the review noted the novel misses its mark with an abundance of two dimensional characters and contrived situations while some may be glad to see a gay hero come out of the closet just in time to save the world

was in to be found in the farina archive in cologne bergamot essential oil is popular in aromatherapy toxicology in several patch test studies application of some sources of bergamot oil directly to the skin of guinea pigs was shown to have a concentration dependent phototoxic effect of increasing redness after exposure to ultraviolet light due to the chemical bergapten and possibly also citropten bergamottin geranial and neral this is a property shared by many other citrus fruits bergapten has also been implicated as a potassium channel blocker in one case study a patient who consumed four litres of earl grey tea per day which contains bergamot essential oil as a flavouring suffered muscle cramps bergamot is also a source of bergamottin which along with the chemically

cholesterol in the blood in a group of patients with confirmed non alcoholic fatty liver disease the extract significantly improved all measured biochemical and ultrasonographic characteristics of the disease in days without reported side effects other studies have shown that bergamot juice reduces serum levels of lipids attributable to its high content of neoeriocitrin neohesperidin and naringin a

to by breivik and the prison requested a background check to be done by the police in the country where the journalist is from no information has been given about the media organisations in question

initially expressed surprise and felt insulted by the conclusions in the report he later said this provides new opportunities the outcome of breivik s first competency evaluation was fiercely debated in norway by mental health experts over the court appointed psychiatrists opinion and the country s definition of criminal insanity an extended panel of experts from the norwegian board of forensic medicine reviewed the submitted report and approved it with no significant remarks news in the meantime emerged that the psychiatric medical staff in charge of treating prisoners at ila detention and security prison did not make any observations that suggested he suffered from either psychosis depression or was suicidal according to senior psychiatrist randi rosenqvist who was commissioned by the prison to examine breivik he rather appeared to have personality disorders counsels representing families and victims filed requests that the court order a second opinion while the prosecuting authority and breivik s lawyer initially did not want new experts to be appointed on january after much public pressure the oslo district court ordered a second expert panel to evaluate breivik s mental state he initially refused to cooperate with new psychiatrists he later changed his mind and in late february a new period of psychiatric observation this time using different methods than the first period was begun if the original diagnosis had been upheld by the court it would have meant that anders behring breivik could not be sentenced to a prison term the prosecution could instead have requested that he be detained in a psychiatric hospital medical advice would then have determined whether or not the courts decided to release him at some later point if considered a perpetual danger to society breivik could have been kept in confinement for life shortly after the second period of pre trial psychiatric observation was begun the prosecution said it expected breivik would be declared legally insane on april the second psychiatric evaluation was published with the conclusion that breivik was not psychotic during the attacks and he was not psychotic during their evaluation instead they diagnosed antisocial personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder breivik expressed hope at being declared sane in a letter sent to several norwegian newspapers shortly before his trial he wrote about the prospect of being sent to a psychiatric ward i must admit this is the worst thing that could have happened to me as it is the ultimate humiliation to send a political activist to a mental hospital is more sadistic and evil than to kill him it is a fate worse than death on june professor of psychiatry ulrik fredrik malt testified in court as an expert witness saying he found it unlikely that breivik had schizophrenia according to malt breivik primarily suffered from asperger syndrome tourette syndrome narcissistic personality disorder and possibly paranoid psychosis malt cited a number of factors in support of his diagnoses including deviant behaviour as a child extreme specialization in breivik s study of weapons and bomb technology strange facial expression a remarkable way of talking and an obsession with numbers eirik johannesen disagreed concluding that breivik was lying and was not delusional or psychotic johannesen had observed and spoken to breivik for more than hours pre trial hearing in the pre trial hearing february breivik read a prepared statement demanding to be released and treated as a hero for his pre emptive attack against traitors accused of planning cultural genocide he said they are committing or planning to commit cultural destruction including deconstruction of the norwegian ethnic group and deconstruction of norwegian culture this is the same as ethnic cleansing criminal trial the criminal trial of breivik began on april in oslo courthouse under the jurisdiction of oslo district court the appointed prosecutors were inga bejer engh and svein holden with geir lippestad serving as breivik s lead counsel for the defence closing arguments were held on june court verdict on august breivik was adjudged

penalty in norway breivik did not appeal and on september media announced that the verdict was final the court said many people share breivik s conspiracy theory including the eurabia theory the court

study prison cell on paper he had three prison cells but because of the government s actions he hardly used the training cell and the study cell prison officers at ila prison were not to speak to him

demanded a sign of life they wanted me to shake a leg every time the slot opened he felt humiliated that the prison officers made such a demand and said they shined a flashlight into the bed depending on the prison officer called into the cell are you alive are you alive until i woke up then they had the sign of life that they needed countless times i was awoken at night after he came to skien prison only out of letters that breivik sent had not been confiscated he added of the forms regarding prison visits that i have mailed all have been confiscated in he was told that he would be locked into an isolation cell for hours a day the decision was reversed in december weeks after the visit by the parliamentary ombudsman breivik talked about the parties nfp and nl that he said later changed name to nordic state nordiske stat breivik said that dark film on all the windows has prevented natural light and it is not possible to see anything outside during large parts of the winter months of the year breivik testified about how the authorities prevent him from buying postage stamps and how skien prison has confiscated envelopes where the stamps are worth several thousand norwegian kroner breivik told about having to wait a long time after having asked for the prison officers to present his toothbrush or asked the prison officers about turning off the tv switch this low level terrorising continued for two years until his transfer to skien prison breivik testified that he had to drink cold coffee because he was not permitted to have a thermos breivik has also complained about announcements over the pa system at ila including that each message was repeated such as now it s time for outdoors recreation it s time for outdoors recreation the pa system was eventually switched off in breivik s section at the prison breivik said that the reservoir of strength that national socialism has given me was finished in december breivik testified that after two years in isolation he has started to love paradise hotel which he says is evidence that he has become seriously brain damaged breivik says that he had not been permitted to publish his correct mailing address breivik said that it is important that oslo district court says what types of addressees pertaining to the postal system are permissible he added that media outlets that he has access to are aftenposten dagen ta and varden and broadcast teletext on several channels he would read other newspapers if he had such access klassekampen is perhaps even more interesting than aftenposten breivik said that isolation is the most effective way to radicalise people because one never gets corrected by others cross examination of witnesses the first witness randi rosenqvist a psychiatrist at ila prison was cross examined by storrvik storrvik asked if she had suggested visits without a glass wall rosenqvist replied yes i have discussed this i have been thinking that visits without a glass wall could be something to consider i don t think that with his image he would be violent to someone he has some sort of a working relationship to storrvik read out loud recommendations by rosenqvist including retired police officers could for example come to socialise with breivik drink coffee play games nrk reported that the parliamentary ombudsman has previously reported that the regimen for serving a prison sentence at the level of particularly high security constitutes a heightened risk of inhumane treatment now it appears that parliamentary ombudsman will not testify this was despite the fact that one of its leaders was on the list of witnesses summoned to testify at the start of the third day of the trial storrvik introduced a report from the prevention section at the office of the parliamentary ombudsman dated november regarding a series of visits that year by the ombudsman the report said that breivik was being held at a section where sometimes there was only one prisoner storrvik read from the report that the limitations on visits at the time of the inspection by the parliamentary ombudsman seemed quite strict he said that in that section of the prison it should expand the planned community between prisoners and employees and consider other measures to minimise the risk of isolation damage at that section the prison should evaluate alternative possibilities for recreation in fresh air in addition to the concrete exercise yard the report recommended that the prison should discontinue the visual surveillance of health related conversations that occur with a glass wall between prisoner and health personnel the second witness was knut bjarkeid chief warden at ila prison storrvik confronted bjarkeid with a document regarding prison section g being turned in part into a particularly high security department he read there are obvious limits to how long he can be in section g the document was written by bjarkeid storrvik said that the words are here obviously there are limits to how long he shall be isolated this was in he is still in total isolation after bjarkeid left the witness stand emberland read out loud from a letter that breivik had written dated september in the letter breivik reported several persons to the police the asker and b rum police district investigated and later dropped the investigation breivik s letter detailed the number of strip searches grip manoeuvres and handcuffings he had undergone the third witness was bj rn draugedalen a general practitioner working one day per week at skien prison his first consultation with breivik was held in a recreation room in avdeling for s rlig h y sikkerhet a high security unit draugedalen shook hands with breivik with five prison officers present all the later consultations until the trial were held with a glass wall separating them storrvik asked this change when another prisoner arrived and started to live in the same prison section which resulted in breivik s movement being restricted did you consider to go up there to view his living conditions or how things were draugedalen answered we have to deal with changes done by the corrections services the judge interjected and she said that the correction services likely would listen to health care workers draugedalen replied that we did not see any extra value then regarding visiting him in the prison section at draugedalen said that he has not been notified that breivik has discontinued his college university studies the fourth witness was haukeland an md for prisoners at ila prison at storrvik read from breivik s medical record dated february that breivik intends to recreate less in fresh air because of the strip searches that follow storrvik asked haukeland the fact that he goes outside less to avoid being strip searched was that discussed as a problem haukeland answered no that was not discussed among the health care workers or in the health section at the judge referred to nightly inspections every half hour and haukeland answers that he cannot remember the judge asked were you the ones who recommended that haukeland replied no the fifth witness was margit kise a section leader at skien prison who served from september to may in section a and h the sixth witness was tore stenshagen also a section leader at skien who served during the third quarter of stenshagen testified that sometimes he sits down in breivik s cell and talks with breivik and sometimes they are accompanied by only one prison officer the seventh witness was j rgen spangen iversen an advisor at the correctional agency iversen was asked why breivik was transferred to skien rather than to ringerike prison iversen answered that he became a case worker in and he was not involved in the transfer closing arguments summing up the case for breivik storrvik said for some reason in norway it has been established that in a female prison a male prison officer cannot strip search a prisoner but in a male prison it is ok that females are present this is offensive i do not see any alternatives he then talked about the case of strip searches of prisoner piechowicz in poland in that case the court was not convinced by the polish government s arguments that the systematic humiliating daily searches were necessary to secure the prison he continued he was also awoken at night but he had visits that compensated and piechowicz s isolation lasted for a shorter period storrvik said note that one calls it isolation even though he had one cellmate storrvik said that the verdict of piechowicz vs poland point to a breach of emk in our case storrvik said in my opinion there is not a complete concurrence between risk analyses and measures in our case risk analyses have at an early stage come with suggestions for measures and these have not been followed up for example removing the glass wall during visits and the possibility of introducing fellow prisoner has been discussed at such an early stage that there should be a good reason for why rosenqvist s advice has not been followed storrvik said that the main problem for the government in this case is that the discrepancies between well founded in the context of security suggestions from one of those who knows this case the best has not been followed storrvik compared breivik s position as a catch situation if breivik says that he has psychiatric problems then he has picked them out of a book if he says that he doesn t have psychiatric problems then he doesn t have psychiatric problems storrvik said that there had been no inspections by agencies tasked with oversight as far as he knew until the parliamentary ombudsman came breivik s lawyer referred to anal inspections visual or manual body cavity searches he disagreed with emberland s view that there was a difference regarding anal inspection as referred to in echr verdicts in other cases and the squats that breivik must perform while naked storrvik s opinion is that ila lacks concrete reasons for all the inspections mestad said that the government s primary task is to protect its citizens to let a convicted terrorist establish a network is dangerous storrvik said breivik s previous verdict indicates a mental vulnerability if that is not enough breivik appears by my standards confused in court storrvik added that in his usage mental vulnerability is a very very weak expression emberland said that storrvik is quoting from the dissenting opinions from verdicts of the echr at least as much as he is quoting the majority opinions of the verdicts on march after the court was adjourned the room where the trial had been held was turned back into the prison gymnasium reactions out of court to breivik s testimony breivik s testimony about his ideology was described as incoherent in dagbladet aina sundt gullhaugen research advisor and psychologist said about prison superintendent bjarkeid s opinion that breivik is not one of the prisoners at ila suffering from isolation and surely it is an ugly sight when humans in the basement at ila smear feces on the walls and no longer are oriented about themselves time or place but those who think that breivik is not suffering have made themselves unavailable for the documented pain that anders partook in during childhood the problem is that breivik expresses his affliction in a manner that does not get captured particularly well by diagnostics manuals the type of fundamental relational and emotional deficiencies that breivik was allowed to develop usually results in that person ending up speaking a language that others don t recognise in aftenposten ulrik fredrik malt expert witness at the trial said that the mass murderer is mentally quite ill and that s being undercommunicated verdict on april district court judge helen anden s sekulic handed down her verdict the verdict said that the conditions of his imprisonment breached article of the european convention on human rights but that article of the convention had not been violated confiscation of letters had been justified the government was also ordered to pay norwegian kroner for the plaintiff s legal expenses incurred by the court case breivik could not receive the money but his lawyer could upon the verdict being upheld breivik was not in any courtroom when he received the verdict media said that his copy would be faxed to the prison the verdict lists points regarding the breach of human rights length of isolation incomplete justification for the measure limited venues for complaints few compensating measures breivik s health condition was not taken into adequate consideration when the regimen of imprisonment was laid down the routine strip searches breivik had to endure after outdoors recreation and the unannounced searches were not adequately justified from a security point of view the verdict said that the prohibition against inhuman and degrading treatment represents a fundamental value in a democratic society it applies no matter what even when dealing with terrorists and killers the verdict highlighted the case of van der ven v the netherlands at ecthr in saying that some of the regular strip searches lacked justification in breivik s case also reactions to verdict and appeal on april news media said that ole kristoffer borhaug the fengselsleder at telemark prison of which skien prison is an affiliate said that the prison regimen for breivik would not be lightened in part because the verdict has not been officially upheld and there are regulations preventing high security prisoners from interacting with prisoners of other categories other reactions to the verdict include those of former convicts kjell alrich schumann said that the verdict is most importantly about the principles regarding the application of isolation in norwegian prisons he added that the decisions are evaluated by an entity at correctional service every six months and they can use any kinds of arguments there is no oversight sven eirik utsi said that one can say whatever one wants about breivik but isolation is something norway has been criticised about for several decades by the ecthr the government s chief lawyer in the trial marius emberland had voiced his opinion about the verdict before the appeal his opinion was criticized by the leader of the norwegian judges association ingjerd thune i clearly understand that many react i have never heard a lawyer speak in that manner ever that was surprising lawyer frode sulland said that one gets the impression that office of the attorney general does not respect the justice system and they still think that they are right even when the court thinks they are wrong emberland eventually recognised that some of his verbal comments can be interpreted as arrogant adding that they really weren t meant that way on may media said that the government had handed in its appeal declaration ankeerkl ring previously the government had announced that it would appeal including the part of the verdict that deals with reimbursing the costs of breivik s legal aid legal scholar mads anden s said that the appeal has no bearing on the responsibility of the government to evaluate and make the changes that the verdict of oslo district court imposes the government to do this results directly from norwegian law and practices of ecthr regarding the question of possibly moving breivik to a prison with other shs prisoners telemark prison s director ole kristoffer borhaug said that the question is the responsibility of the correctional service s region south on august media said that storrvik claims that the judge scheduled to rule in the trial is partial the judge was recused the trial is scheduled to start january one earlier date was rejected by breivik s lawyer storrvik the appeal was originally scheduled to be heard over four days in borgarting lagmannsrett which issued its judgment on march the court of appeals ruled that solitary confinement did not violate breivik s rights on june norway s supreme court upheld the verdict saying that there was no basis for a different conclusion than that by the court of appeals financing of legal aid family situation as of breivik is still receiving pro bono legal aid from the lawfirm of ystein storrvik previously the firm of geir lippestad did pro bono representation of breivik after the trial legal aid during criminal trials has been paid by the government as is the norm in the country on march breivik s mother died from complications from cancer on the same day media said that mother and son took farewell during a meeting at ila last week breivik was permitted to move himself out from behind the glass wall of the visit room to give his mother a farewell hug breivik had asked for permission by the prison officials to attend his mother s funeral service the request was rejected writings and video forums janne kristiansen then chief of the norwegian police security service pst said breivik deliberately desisted from violent exhortations on the net and has more or less been a moderate and has neither been part of any extremist network he is reported to have written many posts on the islam critical website document no he also attended a meeting of documents venner friends of document affiliated with the website in late due to the media attention on his internet activity following the attacks document no compiled a complete list of comments made by breivik on its website between september and june a dagens n ringsliv article said that breivik sought to start a norwegian version of the tea party movement in cooperation with the owners of document no but that they after expressing initial interest turned down his proposal because he did not have the contacts he promised youtube video six hours before the attacks breivik posted a picture of himself as a knight templar officer in a uniform festooned with a gold aiguillette and multiple medals he had not been awarded in the video he put an animation depicting islam as a trojan horse in europe analysts describe it as promoting physical violence towards leftists and islamists who reside in western europe compendium content breivik prepared a document titled a european declaration of independence it has pages credited to andrew berwick breivik admitted in court that it was mostly other people s writings he had copy pasted from different websites the file was e mailed to addresses about minutes before the bomb blast in oslo the document describes two years of preparation of unspecified attacks supposedly planned for late involving a rented volkswagen crafter van small enough not to require a truck driving licence loaded with kilograms lb of ammonium nitrate fuel oil explosive anfo a ruger mini semi automatic rifle a glock pistol personal armour including a shield caltrops and police insignias it also reports that breivik spent thousands of hours gathering email addresses from facebook for distribution of the document and that he rented a farm as a cover for a fake farming company buying fertilizer tons for producing explosives and tons of a harmless kind to avoid suspicion and as a lab it describes burying a crate with the armour in the woods in july collecting it on july and abandoning his plan to replace it with survival gear because he did not have a second pistol it also expresses support for far right groups such as the english defence league and paramilitaries such as the scorpions in the introductory chapter of the manifesto defining cultural marxism in the frankfurt school conspiracy theory sense is a copy of political correctness a short history of an ideology by paul weyrich s free congress foundation major parts of the compendium are attributed to the pseudonymous norwegian blogger fjordman the text also copies sections of the unabomber manifesto without giving credit while replacing the words leftists with cultural marxists and black people with muslims the new york times described american influences in the writings noting that the compendium mentions the anti islamist american robert spencer times and cites spencer s works at great length the work of bat ye or is frequently cited neoconservative blogger pamela geller neo pagan writer koenraad elst and daniel pipes are also mentioned as sources of inspiration the manifesto further contains quotes from thomas jefferson and george orwell as well as from jeremy clarkson s sunday times column and melanie phillips daily mail column the publication speaks in admiration of ayaan hirsi ali geert wilders bruce bawer sr a trifkovi and henryk m broder breivik blames feminism for allowing the erosion of the fabric of european society the compendium advocates a restoration of patriarchy which it claims would save european culture in his writings breivik states that he wants to see european policies on multiculturalism and immigration more similar to those of japan south korea and taiwan which he said are not far from cultural conservatism and nationalism at its best he expressed his admiration for the monoculturalism of japan and for the two nations refusal to accept refugees the jerusalem post describes his support for israel as a far right zionism he calls all nationalists to join in the struggle against cultural marxists multiculturalists he also expressed his admiration of the russian prime minister vladimir putin finding him a fair and resolute leader worthy of respect though he was unsure at this point whether he has the potential to be our best friend or our worst enemy putin s spokesman dmitri peskov has denounced breivik s actions as the delirium of a madman analysis benjamin r teitelbaum former professor of nordic studies current professor of musicology at university of colorado argues that several parts of the manifesto suggest that breivik was concerned about race not only about western culture or christianity labelling him as a white nationalist thomas hegghammer of the norwegian defence research establishment has described the ideologies of breivik as not fitting the established categories of right wing ideology like white supremacism ultranationalism or christian fundamentalism but more akin to macro nationalism and a new doctrine of civilisational war norwegian social scientist lars gule characterised breivik as a national conservative not a nazi pepe egger of the think tank exclusive analysis says the bizarre thing is that his ideas as islamophobic as they are are almost mainstream in many european countries in one section of the manifesto titled battlefield wikipedia breivik explains the importance of using wikipedia as a venue for disseminating views and information to the general public although the norwegian professor arnulf hagen claims that this was a document that he had copied from another author and that breivik was unlikely to be a contributor to wikipedia according to the leader of the norwegian chapter of the wikimedia foundation an account has been identified which they believe breivik used on the second day of his trial breivik cited wikipedia as the main source for his worldview religious and political views hatred of islam following his apprehension breivik was characterised by analysts as being a right wing extremist with anti muslim views and a deep seated hatred of islam who considered himself a knight dedicated to stemming the tide of muslim immigration into europe he was at first described by many in the media as a christian fundamentalist christian terrorist and nationalist he claims that the european union is a project to create eurabia and describes the nato bombing of yugoslavia as being authorised by criminal western european and american leaders in his writings breivik states that the battle of vienna in should be celebrated as the independence day for all western europeans as it was the beginning of the end for the second islamic wave of jihads the manifesto urges the hindu nationalists to drive muslims out of india it demands the forced deportation of all muslims from europe based on the model of the bene decrees religion his religious faith is odinism but breivik and others have previously linked his religious beliefs to christianity the manifesto states its author is percent christian but he is not excessively religious i m not going to pretend i m a very religious person as that would be a lie and considers himself a cultural christian and a modern day crusader he calls religion a crutch and a source for drawing mental strength and says i ve always been very pragmatic and influenced by my secular surroundings and environment regarding the term cultural christian which he says means preserving european culture he notes it is enough that you are a christian agnostic or a christian atheist an atheist who wants to preserve at least the basics of the european christian cultural legacy furthermore breivik said myself and many more like me do not necessarily have a personal relationship with jesus christ and god nevertheless he said he planned to pray to god for help during his attacks before the attacks he stated an intention to attend frogner church in a final martyr s mass breivik condemned pope benedict xvi for his dialogue with islam pope benedict has abandoned christianity and all christian europeans and is to be considered a cowardly incompetent corrupt and illegitimate pope it will thus be necessary writes breivik to overthrow the protestant and catholic hierarchies after which a great christian congress would set up a new european church he has also condemned christian missionary activity in india as it would lead to the total destruction of the hindu faith and culture and he expresses support for the hindutva movement against indian communist movements in he wrote today s protestant church is a joke priests in jeans who march for palestine and churches that look like minimalist shopping centres i am a supporter of an indirect collective conversion of the protestant church back to the catholic the american christian press has suggested that breivik also appears to have directly addressed followers of the neopagan religion of odinism saying even odinists can fight with us or by our side as brothers in the knights templar organisation of which breivik claims to be a founding member he later advocated rejecting odinism however saying that thor s hammer could not unify the people of europe but that the christian cross would deputy police chief roger andresen initially told reporters that information on breivik s websites was so to speak christian fundamentalist and many mainstream media such as the new york times have described him a christian fundamentalist others however have disputed andresen s characterisation of breivik as a christian fundamentalist in letters sent to norwegian newspaper dagen in breivik said that he is not and has never been a christian and that he thinks there are few things in the world more pathetic than the jesus figure and his message he said he prays and sacrifices to odin and identifies his religion as odinism intellectual influences breivik has identified himself in a multitude of social media services as an admirer of among others the freedom party of austria hindu nationalism hindutva the right wing swiss people s party winston churchill max manus robert spencer former japanese prime minister taro aso patrick buchanan ayaan hirsi ali radovan karad i sr a trifkovi and dutch politician geert wilders whose political party he described on the website of the periodical minerva as one among the few that could truly claim to be conservative parties in their whole culture wilders quickly distanced himself from breivik and denounced him as violent and sick on twitter he paraphrased philosopher john stuart mill one person with a belief is equal to the force of who have only interests breivik had been active on several anti islamic and nationalist blogs including document no and was a regular reader of gates of vienna the brussels journal and jihad watch breivik has frequently praised the writings of blogger fjordman he used fjordman s thinking to justify his actions citing him times in the manifesto he also endorsed the writings of australian historian keith windschuttle in the manifesto as well as former australian prime minister john howard and former czech president v clav klaus he expressed admiration for historical military leaders such as charles martel richard the lionheart el cid vlad the impaler jacques de molay nicholas i of russia john hunyadi and john iii sobieski in his manifest he copies pages verbatim from an ideological text by evan kohlmann and published by an institute led by magnus ranstorp after studying several militant groups including ira eta and others breivik suggests far right militants should adopt al qaeda s methods learn from their success and avoid their mistakes breivik described al qaeda as the most successful revolutionary force in the world and praised their cult of martyrdom in a letter sent by breivik to international media in january breivik states that he exploited counterjihadist rhetoric in order to protect ethno nationalists and start a media hunt against anti nationalist counterjihadist supporters in a strategy he calls double psychology breivik further states that he strives for a pure nordic ideal advocating the establishment of a similar party in norway to the now defunct neo nazi party of the swedes and identifying himself as a part of western europe s fascist movement moreover he states that his support for israel is limited for it to function as a place to deport disloyal jews during the trial in breivik listed as his influences a number of neo nazi activists as well as perpetrators of attacks against immigrants and leftists considering them heroes links to organizations shooting club breivik was an active member of an oslo shooting club between and and since according to the club which banned him for life after the attacks breivik had taken part in organized training sessions and one competition since june the club states that it does not evaluate the members suitability regarding possession of weapons freemasons at the time of the attacks breivik was a member of the lodge of st olaf at the three columns in oslo and had displayed photographs of himself in partial masonic regalia on his facebook profile in interviews after the attacks his lodge said it had only minimal contact with him and that when made aware of breivik s membership grand master of the norwegian order of freemasons ivar a skaar issued an edict immediately excluding him from the fraternity based upon the acts he carried out and the values that appear to have motivated them according to the lodge records breivik took part in a total of four meetings between his initiation in february and his exclusion from the order one each to receive the first second and third degree and one other meeting and held no offices or functions within the lodge skaar said that although breivik was a member of the order his actions showed that he is in no way a mason progress party breivik became a member of the progress party frp in he paid his membership dues for the last time in and was removed from the membership lists in during his time in the progress party he held two positions in the progress party s youth organisation fpu he was the chair of the local vest oslo branch from january to october and a member of the board of the same branch from october till november after the attack the progress party immediately distanced itself from breivik s actions and ideas at a press conference ketil solvik olsen said that breivik left us the party because we were too liberal english defence league edl breivik claimed he had contact with the far right english defence league edl a movement in the united kingdom that has been accused of islamophobia he allegedly had extensive links with senior edl members and wrote that he attended an edl demonstration in bradford on july edl leader tommy robinson denounced breivik and his attacks and has denied any official links with him on july interpol asked maltese police to investigate paul ray a former edl member who blogs under the name lionheart ray conceded that he may have been an inspiration for breivik but deplored his actions in an online discussion on the norwegian website document no on december breivik proposes to establish a norwegian version of the edl breivik saw this as the only way to stop left wing radical groups like blitz and sos rasisme from harassing norwegian cultural conservatives following the establishment of the european defence league the norwegian defence league ndl launched in breivik indeed became a member of this organization under the pseudonym sigurd jorsalfar former head of the ndl lena andreassen claims that breivik was ejected from the organization when she took over as leader in march because he was too extreme knights templar in his manifesto and during interrogation breivik claimed membership in an international christian military order which he calls the new pauperes commilitones christi templique solomonici pccts knights templar according to breivik the order was established as an anti jihad crusader organisation that fights against islamic suppression in london in april by nine men two englishmen a frenchman a german a dutchman a greek a russian a norwegian apparently breivik and a serb supposedly the initiator not present but represented by breivik the compendium gives a estimate that there are between and justiciar knights in western europe and an unknown number of civilian members and breivik expects the order to take political and military control of western europe breivik gives his own code name in the organisation as sigurd and that of his assigned mentor as richard after the twelfth century crusaders and kings sigurd jorsalfar of norway and richard the lionheart of england he calls himself a one man cell of this organisation and claims that the group has several other cells in western countries including two more in norway on august breivik offered to provide information about these cells but on unrealistic preconditions after an intense investigation assisted internationally by several security agencies the norwegian police have not found any evidence that a pccts network existed or that the alleged london meeting ever took place the police now view breivik s claim as a figment of imagination in light of his schizophrenia diagnosis and are increasingly confident that he had no accessories the perpetrator still insists he belongs to an order and that his one man cell was activated by another clandestine cell on august several norwegian politicians and media outlets received an email from someone claiming to be breivik s deputy demanding that breivik be released and making more threats against norwegian society notable related books on august journalist marit christensen informed the norwegian press that for the last year of wenche behring breivik s life she had been her confidant and that a book based on christensen s interviews with her would be published as a book in late under the title the mother on september verdens gang said that before wenche behring breivik died she hired a lawyer to prevent christensen from publishing the book the book was nevertheless published in october and was widely criticized on the basis of wenche behring breivik s opposition to the book for inclusion of material not relevant to understanding what motivated anders behring breivik and for character assassinations of still living people in popular culture in january the danish theatre caf teatret announced that it was staging a play based on the manifesto the play named manifesto was planned to 
en,the oslo tunnel norwegian oslotunnelen is a metre double track railway tunnel which runs between olav kyrres plass and oslo central station oslo s in oslo norway the tunnel constitutes the eastern most section of the drammen line and runs below the central business district of oslo it features the four track nationaltheatret station norway s second busiest railway station where the oslo tunnels lies directly beneath the common tunnel of the oslo metro at frogner the elisenberg station was built but has never been used the tunnel is the busiest section of railway line in norway and serves all west bound trains from oslo including many services of the oslo commuter rail and the airport express train traditionally oslo had two stations the larger oslo east station or oslo located at the spot of the current oslo s and oslo west station oslo v which served the drammen line this caused a physical barrier between the two parts of the railway network only connected by the oslo port line which ran partly in city streets formal planning of a central station and a tunnel connecting the drammen line to oslo started in and the final plans were approved in the oslo tunnel opened on june and made it possible to close oslo v in nationaltheatret saw a major upgrade in when it was expanded to four tracks and from to the tunnel will see a major technical upgrade there are plans to build a second tunnel to increase train capacity west of oslo route the tunnel constitutes the easternmost meters mi of the drammen line and runs between oslo s and sk yen at oslo s of the tracks platforms through connect to the tunnel which is shaped as a funnel eventually merging the twelve tracks into two the tunnel runs below some important heritage buildings in oslo including basarhallene the parliament of norway building and oslo cathedral nationaltheatret station is the second busiest railway station in the country and is located below the oslo metro station with the same name the station has four tracks and two meter ft long island platforms serving the central business district of oslo through this section the line runs below the common tunnel of the oslo metro for meters ft at this point the line is meters ft below the surface elisenberg station located in frogner is partially built including a meter ft long island platform and one of the entrances the line follows bygd y all and surfaces just west of olav kyrres plass immediately afterwards the sk yen filipstad line merges into the drammen line the next station along the line is sk yen station service the oslo tunnel is the most heavily trafficked section of mainline railway in norway it has a theoretical capacity of trains per hour in each direction and an applied capacity of trains per hour in each direction in rush hour there are up to trains operating through the tunnel with a capacity of passengers per hour all eight lines of the oslo commuter rail have some or all of their services operate through the tunnel although many of these terminate at sk yen the airport express train operates four hourly services through the tunnel and the norwegian state railways operate regional trains along the vestfold line and intercity trains along the s rland line and bergen line through the tunnel freight trains along the s rland line operate through the tunnel although only at night while freight trains along the bergen line do not instead using the roa h nefoss line history by the s oslo had two main railway stations oslo east station and oslo west station the drammen line consisting of commuter trains and regional and intercity trains from the s rland line and the vestfold line terminated at oslo v the stfold trunk and gj vik lines terminated at oslo between the two stations ran the oslo port line which in part ran in the city streets and was only used for a limited number of freight trains several plans had been launched to connect the two stations with the most prominent being a line running west of oslo and merging with the gj vik line at grefsen and an elevated line from oslo v to tordensskiolds plass in a tunnel under akershus fortress and again as an elevated line past oslo stock exchange to oslo in the station committee of was established to look into a possible connection of the drammen line to oslo and extension of the railway station led by axel grenholm the committee recommended one of two alternatives either establish a branch from the drammen line and built a tunnel under the city center in which all trains would terminate at oslo the tunnel was proposed run from lassons gate west of oslo v to fred olsens gate with an intermediate station close to the location of oslo v the proposed tunnel would be meters mi long and largely run through clay making construction more difficult and expensive alternatively a branch of drammen line should be built around the city and connect with the gj vik line at grefsen commuter trains would continue to run to oslo v while regional and intercity trains would run to oslo the committee stated that it preferred the former suggestion in the planning office for oslo central station led by fin hvoslef was established by the government in they presented a new report which recommended that a new route for the tunnel be considered to ease construction and increase safety this was in part based on an engineering report from which had made the first detailed plans for the line it was a compromise between the norwegian state railways need for a line as straight as possible and oslo municipality s demands that the construction should not be a risk to buildings in the area the ground in oslo consists of clay filled grooves up to meters ft deep the area also contains alum shale which expands when it comes into contact with air and water and can attack concrete argillaceous schist cracks with clay and water and hard volcanic rocks another committee led by oddvar halvorsen was established in to look at the matter again also it recommended a tunnel and a central station however it felt that the tunnel should be longer and intersect with the drammen line at a point between skarpsno and sk yen and build a second station at frogner the proposal was presented to the parliament of norway on november along with several other matters related to rail transport investments construction of the oslo tunnel and oslo central station was passed unanimously another planning office was established in initially led by erik himle the final plans for the route were passed by parliament in and construction started in the main contractors were ingeni r thor furuholmen dipl ing kaare backer nsb jernbaneanlegget oslo sentralstasjon and ingeni rbygg consultants included ingeni rene bonde co peer qvam s arkitektkontor and the norwegian geotechnical institute the tunnel was officially opened on may by minister of transport and communications ronald bye and officially taken into use on june when it opened it was the eighth longest railway tunnel in norway although since it has been the thirteenth longest the tunnel cost million norwegian krone nok of which oslo municipality had paid nok million at first the tunnel was used by commuter trains from lillestr m to drammen and spikkestad and trains from eidsvoll and rnes used the tunnel and turned at sk yen oslo central station was taken into use on november on may oslo west station was closed and all traffic transferred to oslo s in october construction of an upgraded nationaltheatret station started and was taken into use on december the work expanded the station from two to four platforms thus increasing the applied capacity for the whole tunnel from to trains per direction per hour the expansion cost nok million which included blasting cubic metres cu ft of rock and pouring cubic metres cu ft of concrete the work resulted in meters ft of new tunnel a new entrance hall and art the station was designed for passengers daily in the old section of nationaltheatret station was renovated upgrades included new lighting a new public address system new escalators a more powerful fire safety system improved emergency exits and replacement of cables the upgrade made the old section lighter as it was previously painted in dark red and visually similar to the new section between and the norwegian national rail administration is performing a major upgrade to the section between lysaker and etterstad including the oslo tunnel among the upgrades are axle counters mounting of an overhead conductor rail new switches switch heaters at the tunnel openings and new tracks future the oslo tunnel is the largest bottle neck in the railway system in norway and delays caused around the tunnel can spread throughout the whole network the local rail lines have only one or two departures per hour but more are desired in order to attract people who want to find departure times matching work hours the now defunct national rail administration had stated that until at the earliest it is unnecessary with more capacity through the west corridor i e running west of oslo this includes possible ungraded to the railway lines around oslo such as high speed lines along the stfold and vestfold lines and to lillehammer in after the completion of the asker line a new schedule plan has been proposed nsb the airport express train and cargonet have all asked for more slots through the tunnel than is available one possible solution is to decrease the reserve capacity thus increasing the capacity from to trains per hour per direction however the tunnel is already characterized as critically overloaded should a new tunnel be built it would not necessarily run next to the oslo tunnel one proposal from the national rail administration calls for a separate commuter train station to be built underground at the location of oslo bus terminal within walking distance of oslo s this proposal involves the line connecting to the existing route before reaching nationaltheatret the lobby organisation norsk bane have called for a line to run further north and serve majorstuen where there is a major metro and tramway hub norsk bane also call for the tunnel to be built for higher speeds and state that it is necessary to build high speed rail to bergen and stavanger combined with a new line from drammen

en,the pacific bluefin tuna thunnus orientalis is a predatory species of tuna found widely in the northern pacific ocean but it is migratory and also recorded as a visitor to the south pacific in the past it was often included in t thynnus the combined species then known as the northern bluefin tuna when treated as separate t thynnus is called the atlantic bluefin tuna it may reach as much as m ft in length and kg lb in weight like the closely related atlantic bluefin and southern bluefin the pacific bluefin is a commercially valuable species and several thousand tonnes are caught each year making it overfished it is considered threatened by the iucn and pew monterey bay aquarium s seafood watch program have placed all bluefin tunas on the avoid list and they are also placed on the red list by greenpeace and the blue ocean institute according to stock assessments completed in and by the international scientific committee for tuna and tuna like species in the north pacific ocean isc the present day population is at just percent of its historic levels the overall fishing mortality rate for this species remains up to three times higher than is sustainable physiology thermoregulation almost all fish are cold blooded ectothermic however tuna and mackerel sharks are warm blooded they can regulate their body temperature warm blooded fish possess organs near their muscles called retia mirabilia that consist of a series of minute parallel veins and arteries that supply and drain the muscles as the warmer blood in the veins returns to the gills for fresh oxygen it comes into close contact with cold newly oxygenated blood in the arteries the system acts as a counter current heat exchanger and the heat from the blood in the veins is given up to the colder arterial blood rather than being lost at the gills the net effect is less heat loss through the gills fish from warmer water elevate their temperature a few degrees whereas those from cold water may raise it as much as c f warmer than the surrounding sea the tuna s ability to maintain body temperature has several definite advantages over other sea life it need not limit its range according to water temperature nor is it dominated by climatic changes the additional heat supplied to the muscles is also advantageous because of the resulting extra power and speed bluefin tuna have been clocked in excess of miles per hour km h during to second sprints enabling it to hunt squid herring mackerel etc that slower predators cannot capture distribution the pacific bluefin tuna is primarily found in the north pacific ranging from the east asian coast to the western coast of north america it is mainly a pelagic species found in temperate oceans but it also ranges into the tropics and more coastal regions it typically occurs from the surface to m ft but has been recorded as deep as m ft it spawns in the northwestern philippine sea e g off honshu okinawa and taiwan and in the sea of japan some of these migrate to the east pacific and return to the spawning grounds after a few years it has been recorded more locally as a visitor to the southern hemisphere including off australia new zealand gulf of papua and french polynesia the species is considered to consist of only one stock life history pacific bluefin tunas reach maturity at about years of age the generation length is estimated at years and based on two separate sources the longevity is year or years at maturity it is about m ft in long and weighs about kg lb individuals that are m ft in long are regularly seen and the maximum reported is m ft in length and kg lb in weight elsewhere a mass of up to kg lb has been reported for the species according to the international game fish association the all tackle game fish record was a kg lb individual donna pascoe caught on february onboard charter boat gladiator during the national tournament spawning occurs from april to august but the exact timing depends on the region early in the northwest philippine sea the southern part of its breeding range and late in the sea of japan the northern part of its breeding range large females can carry more eggs than small ones and between million and million eggs have been reported pacific bluefins eat various small schooling squids and fishes but have also been recorded taking sessile animals pelagic red crabs and krill conservation status unlike the other bluefins atlantic and southern the pacific bluefin tuna was not considered threatened initially resulting in a least concern rating in in it was found to be threatened and the status was upgraded to vulnerable overfishing is occurring in the pacific bluefin but overall the stock was not yet believed to be in an overfished condition in in it was estimated that the complete spawning biomass was of the historically observed spawning biomass in scientists found a drastic population decline estimated at due to overfishing in between tonnes and tonnes were caught per year its wide range and migratory behavior leads to some problems since fisheries in the species are managed by several different regional fisheries management organisations that sometimes give conflicting advice the iucn have recommended that the responsibility is moved to a single organisation other recommendations include a substantial reduction of fishing of this species especially juveniles as much as of the caught pacific bluefins are juveniles monterey bay aquarium s seafood watch program have placed all bluefin tunas on the avoid list and they are also placed on the red list by both greenpeace and the blue ocean institute pacific bluefin flesh may contain levels of mercury or pcbs that are harmful to humans that consume it a similar problem exists in other tuna species about of the pacific and atlantic bluefin tunas are consumed in japan and tunas that are particular suited for sashimi and sushi can reach very high prices in japan some foods made available for the first time of the year are considered good luck especially bluefin tuna winning these new year auctions is often used as a way to get publicity which raises the prices considerably higher than their market value on january a pound kg pacific bluefin tuna caught off northeastern japan was sold in the first auction of the year at the tsukiji fish market in tokyo for a record million yen us million leading to record unit prices of per pound or per kilogram farming japan is both the biggest consumer and the leader in tuna farming research kinki university of japan first successfully farmed already hatched bluefin tuna in in they succeeded in breeding them and in the process was repeated for a third generation this farm raised tuna is now known as kindai tuna

en,giuseppe giannini pancetti better known as jos pancetti campinas june rio de janeiro february was a brazilian modernist painter biography born into a humble family of immigrants from tuscany italy he lived in campinas until he was years old when his father a master carpenter moved with his wife and children to the state capital s o paulo where he hoped to find better working conditions one year later jos and one of his sisters moved to italy to live under the care of an uncle and grandparents in italy arriving at the house of his uncle casimiro he started to study at the salesian college in massa carrara but shortly thereafter the country would be involved in world war i and pancetti had to be moved to the countryside home of his grandparents in the town of pietrasanta there he learned the craft of a carpenter in a small workshop but he didn t like the routine of the job and thus went to work always briefly in some factories until the conflict ended wishing to fix a better job for jos his uncle arranged for him to be a sailor in the italian merchant navy where he learned the seafaring profession he boarded the maria rosa sailboat which ran trips throughout the mediterranean especially between the ports of genoa and alexandria but the fickleness of his character caused him to leave the ship and to go wandering the streets of genoa with serious problems of subsistence until someone took him to the brazilian consulate which provided for his return to brazil back in brazil thus on february he landed in santos to survive he worked in different places and different crafts until in he moved to s o paulo again where a businessman also of italian origin offered him a job as a painter of walls and posters which seems to have been his first contact with painting in that same year the painter adolfo fonzari offered to pancetti an opportunity to assist him in decorating the house of another italian in the coast of guaruj then in pancetti enlisted into the brazilian navy where he was to remain for years until the discovery of painting aboard the navy ships pancetti was given the task of painting hulls walls etc he did this with such a zeal that his fame spread throughout the navy until an admiral created a cadre of experts in the profession and appointed pancetti as its first teacher of painting but being a wall painter became boring and upon the humble sailor dawned a desire to put into paper what his eyes saw and so pancetti began to draw and to paint postcards with landscapes seascapes and romantic sceneries still quite clumsy but which already showed his considerable artistic potential during the s o paulo constitutional revolution of pancetti watched and painted a scene depicting a warplane downed by machine guns of the cruiser rio grande do sul on board of which he was the painting was acquired and published by the weekly noite ilustrada and that how he was professionally started in the fine arts in while walking through the campo de santana in rio de janeiro he observed a painter in his chores to capture the city s landscape so rich in wonderful scenery to offer the man seemed friendly and pleasant enough and this encouraged him to strike up a conversation by asking about the painting and confessing his desire to learn to paint the artist was giuseppe gargaglione who advised him to seek the n cleo bernardelli a free painting school that operated in the building of the rio de janeiro school of fine arts pancetti accepted the suggestion and was admitted to the n cleo where his main advisor was painter bruno lechowski at n cleo bernardelli two years later in pancetti married anita caruso with whom he had two children his recognition as a painter began in with a participation at the sal o nacional de belas artes national fine arts exhibition he was invited again in and in he was awarded one of the prizes which gave out an educational trip to europe his first solo exhibition took place years later only in featuring more than of his paintings his first international exhibition took place in at the venice biennale the following year he was accepted at the first international art biennial of art s o paulo having participated also in the third biennial death unfortunately pancetti uncle of isaurinha garcia one of the most popular singers of brazil in the s and s suffered from tuberculosis he spent some time in the spa cities of campos do jord o and s o jo o del rei seeking a rest cure he died in in the naval hospital of rio de janeiro and was laid to rest in the s o jo o batista cemetery in the quarter of botafogo assessment pancetti specialized in painting mostly seascape marinhas in portuguese and is notable for that but he also liked to paint still life landscape figure and portrait painting while living pancetti enjoyed a relatively late recognition his production was not very prolific so his paintings are rare and in the hands mostly of private collectors after his death his fame grew very much and his paintings are highly valued and command one of the best selling prices among brazilian modernist painters nowadays indicative would be prices in of around usd to about for his seascapes whilst a portrait or a still life might only attract from less than to less than quote certa vez n o sei como tive vontade de pintar aquilo que meus olhos viram na louca carreira do mar

en,self regulation theory srt is a system of conscious personal management that involves the process of guiding one s own thoughts behaviors and feelings to reach goals self regulation consists of several stages and individuals must function as contributors to their own motivation behavior and development within a network of reciprocally interacting influences roy baumeister one of the leading social psychologists who have studied self regulation claims it has four components standards of desirable behavior motivation to meet standards monitoring of situations and thoughts that precede breaking said standards and lastly willpower baumeister along with other colleagues developed three models of self regulation designed to explain its cognitive accessibility self regulation as a knowledge structure strength or skill studies have been done to determine that the strength model is generally supported because it is a limited resource in the brain and only a given amount of self regulation can occur until that resource is depleted srt can be applied to impulse control the management of short term desires people with low impulse control are prone to acting on immediate desires this is one route for such people to find their way to jail as many criminal acts occur in the heat of the moment for non violent people it can lead to losing friends through careless outbursts or financial problems caused by making too many impulsive purchases the cognitive bias known as illusion of control to the extent that people are driven by internal goals concerned with the exercise of control over their environment they will seek to reassert control in conditions of chaos uncertainty or stress failing genuine control one coping strategy will be to fall back on defensive attributions of control leading to illusions of control fenton o creevy et al goal attainment and motivation sickness behavior srt consists of several stages first the patient deliberately monitors one s own behavior and evaluates how this behavior affects one s health if the desired effect is not realized the patient changes personal behavior if the desired effect is realized the patient reinforces the effect by continuing the behavior kanfer another approach is for the patient to realize a personal health issue and understand the factors involved in that issue the patient must decide upon an action plan for resolving the health issue the patient will need to deliberately monitor the results in order to appraise the effects checking for any necessary changes in the action plan leventhal nerenz another factor that can help the patient reach his her own goal of personal health is to relate to the patient the following help them figure out the personal community views of the illness appraise the risks involved and give them potential problem solving coping skills four components of self regulation described by baumeister et al are standards of desirable behavior motivation to meet standards monitoring of situations and thoughts that precede breaking standards willpower internal strength to control urges history and contributors albert bandura there have been numerous researchers psychologists and scientists that have studied self regulatory processes albert bandura a cognitive psychologist had significant contributions focusing on the acquisition of behaviors that led to the social cognitive theory and social learning theory his work brought together behavioral and cognitive components in which he concluded that humans are able to control their behavior through a process known as self regulation this led to his known process that contained self observation judgement and self response self observation also known as introspection is a process involving assessing one s own thoughts and feelings in order to inform and motivate the individual to work towards goal setting and become influenced by behavioral changes judgement involves an individual comparing his or her performance to their personal or created standards lastly self response is applied in which an individual may reward or punish his or herself for success or failure in meeting standard s an example of self response would be rewarding oneself with an extra slice of pie for doing well on an exam dale schunk and barry zimmerman expanding beyond bandura s three steps dale schunk and barry zimmerman two educational psychologists have collaborated and researched the effects of social and instructional variables on self regulation they have reviewed how specific strategies enhance individual learning processes and how it orients toward self regulation and achievement processes including self observation self evaluation self reaction and self efficacy self observation may be considered insufficient because motivation depends on one s expectations of outcomes and efficacy self evaluation is where an individual compares his or her current performance to a desired one schunk and zimmerman state that specific goals specify the amount of effort required for success and boost self efficacy because progress is easy to gauge they describe the two types of self evaluation as absolute or normative an example of an absolute standard is an academic grading scale where as a normative standard would involve evaluating oneself s performance when individuals achieve these valued goals they re more likely to continue to exert a high level of effort since sub standard performance will no longer provide satisfaction self reaction is the third element in which one can be motivated through reactions by others for example if one s performance received numerous positive acknowledgments that individual may have a feeling of self efficacy whereas a negative self evaluation would likely motivate an individual to work harder self reaction also allows a person to re evaluate his or her goals in conjunction with attainments lastly self efficacy is the belief that goal completion is enough motivation in it self and can refer to how people have preconceived judgments about how they are able to perform certain tasks roy baumeister as a widely studied theory srl was also greatly impacted by the well known social psychologist roy baumeister he described the ability to self regulate as limited in capacity and through this he coined the term ego depletion the four components of self regulation theory described by roy baumeister are standards of desirable behavior motivation to meet standards monitoring of situations and thoughts that precede breaking standards and willpower or the internal strength to control urges in baumeister s paper titled self regulation failure an overview he express that self regulation is complex and multifaceted baumeister lays out his three ingredients of self regulation as a case for self regulation failure the first involves standards without specific ideals for standards there may be conflicting dilemmas that will cease self regulation the second ingredient is monitoring in that if it is not performed individuals can lose control of success and attentiveness to behaviors for example individuals who undermine their competence to fulfill a task may not even attempt to reach that goal the third is a somewhat more complex and states that when a current state or behavior is falling short to reach a goal or standard a certain cognitive process will be triggered to accommodate this self regulation is a process that may be under regulated mis regulated or neglected and because of this it can be viewed as a strength in the brain baumeister concludes his work with the theory that an individual must be able to work through immediate situations by considering long term implications as well as having a structured sense of relaxation and a healthy sense of impulse control research many studies have been done to test different variables regarding self regulation albert bandura studied self regulation before after and during the response he created the triangle of reciprocal determinism that includes behavior environment and the person cognitive emotional and physical factors that all influence one another bandura concluded that the processes of goal attainment and motivation stem from an equal interaction of self observation self reaction self evaluation and self efficacy in addition to bandura s work psychologists muraven tice and baumeister conducted a study for self control as a limited resource they suggested there were three competing models to self regulation self regulation as a strength knowledge structure and a skill in the strength model they indicated it is possible self regulation could be considered a strength because it requires willpower and thus is a limited resource failure to self regulate could then be explained by depletion of this resource for self regulation as a knowledge structure they theorized it involves a certain amount of knowledge to exert self control so as with any learned technique failure to self regulate could be explained by insufficient knowledge lastly the model involving self regulation as a skill referred to self regulation being built up over time and unable to be diminished therefore failure to exert would be explained by a lack of skill they found that self regulation as a strength is the most feasible model due to studies that have suggested self regulation is a limited resource dewall baumeister gailliot and maner performed a series of experiments instructing participants to perform ego depletion tasks to diminish the self regulatory resource in the brain that they theorized to be glucose this included tasks that required participants to break a familiar habit where they read an essay and circled words containing the letter e for the first task then were asked to break that habit by performing a second task where they circled words containing e and or a following this trial participants were randomly assigned to either the glucose category where they drank a glass of lemonade made with sugar or the control group with lemonade made from splenda they were then asked their individual likelihoods of helping certain people in hypothetical situations for both kin and non kin and found that excluding kin people were much less likely to help a person in need if they were in the control group with splenda than if they had replenished their brain glucose supply with the lemonade containing real sugar this study also supports the model for self regulation as a strength because it confirms it is a limited resource baumeister and colleagues expanded on this and determined the four components to self regulation those include standards of desirable behavior motivation to meet these standards monitoring of situations and thoughts that precede breaking standards and willpower applications and examples impulse control in self regulation involves the separation of our immediate impulses and long term desires we can plan evaluate our actions and refrain from doing things we will regret research shows that self regulation is a strength necessary for emotional well being violation of one s deepest values results in feelings of guilt which will undermine well being the illusion of control involves people overestimating their own ability to control events such as when an event occurs an individual may feel greater a sense of control over the outcome that they demonstrably do not influence this emphasizes the importance of perception of control over life events the self regulated learning is the process of taking control and evaluating one s own learning and behavior this emphasizes control by the individual who monitors directs and regulates actions toward goals of information in goal attainment self regulation it is generally described in these four components of self regulation standards which is the desirable behavior motivation to meet the standards monitoring situations and thoughts that precede breaking standards willpower internal strength to control urges illness behavior in self regulation deals with issues of tension that arise between holding on and letting go of important values and goals as those are threatened by disease processes also people who have poor self regulatory skills do not succeed in relationships or cannot hold jobs sayette describes failures in self regulation as in two categories under regulation and misregualtion under regulation is when people fail to control oneself whereas misregualtion deals with having control but does not bring up the desired goal sayette criticisms challenges one challenge of self regulation is that researchers often struggle with the conceptualization and operationalization of self regulation carver scheier the system of self regulation comprises a complex set of functions including research cognition problem solving decision making and meta cognition ego depletion refers to self control or willpower drawing from a limited pool of mental resources if an individual has low mental activity self control is typically impaired which may lead to ego depletion self control plays a valuable role in the functioning of self in people the illusion of control involves the overestimation of an individual s ability to control certain events it occurs when someone feels a sense of control over outcomes although they may not possess this control psychologists have consistently emphasized the importance of perceptions of control over life events heider proposed that humans have a strong motive to control their environment reciprocal determinism is a theory proposed by albert bandura stating that a person s behavior is influenced both by personal factors and the social environment bandura acknowledges the possibility that individual s behavior and personal factors may impact the environment these can involve skills that are either under or overcompensating the ego and will not benefit the outcome of the situation recently baumeister s strength model of ego depletion has been criticized in multiple ways meta analyses found little evidence for the strength model of self regulation and for glucose as the limited resource that is depleted a pre registered trial did not find any evidence for ego depletion several commentaries have raised criticism on this particular study in summary many central assumptions of the strength model of self regulation seem to be in need of revision especially the view of self regulation as a limited resource that can be depleted and glucose as the fuel that is depleted seems to be hardly defensible without major revisions conclusion self regulation can be applied to many aspects of every day life including social situations personal health management impulse control and more since the strength model is generally supported ego depletion tasks can be performed to temporarily tax the amount of self regulatory capabilities in a person s brain it is theorized that self regulation depletion is associated with willingness to help people in need excluding members of an individual s kin many researchers have contributed to these findings including albert bandura roy baumeister and robert wood see also rubicon model

en,the rodrigues parrot necropsittacus rodricanus is an extinct species of parrot that was endemic to the mascarene island of rodrigues in the indian ocean east of madagascar it is unclear to which other species it is most closely related but it is classified as a member of the tribe psittaculini along with other mascarene parrots the rodrigues parrot bore similarities to the broad billed parrot of mauritius and may have been related two additional species have been assigned to its genus n francicus and n borbonicus based on descriptions of parrots from the other mascarene islands but their identities and validity have been debated the rodrigues parrot was green and had a proportionally large head and beak along with a long tail its exact size is unknown but it may have been around cm in long it was the largest parrot on rodrigues and it had the largest head of any mascarene parrot it may have looked similar to the great billed parrot by the time it was discovered it frequented and nested on islets off southern rodrigues where introduced rats were absent and fed on the seeds of the fernelia buxifolia shrub the species is known from subfossil bones and from mentions in contemporary accounts it was last mentioned in and probably became extinct soon after perhaps due to a combination of predation by rats deforestation and hunting by humans taxonomy birds thought to be the rodrigues parrot were first mentioned by fran ois leguat in his memoir a new voyage to the east indies leguat was the leader of a group of nine french huguenot refugees who colonised rodrigues between and after they were marooned there subsequent accounts were by julien tafforet who was marooned on the island in in his relation de l le rodrigue and then by the french mathematician alexandre pingr who travelled to rodrigues to view the transit of venus the rodrigues parrot was scientifically described and named as psittacus rodricanus in by the french ornithologist alphonse milne edwards based on a subfossil partial beak the specific name refers to rodrigues which is itself named after the discoverer of the island the portuguese navigator diogo rodrigues milne edwards corrected the spelling of the specific name to rodericanus in in a compilation of his articles about extinct birds a spelling which was used in the literature henceforward but it was changed back to rodricanus by the ioc world bird list in milne edwards moved the species to its own genus necropsittacus in the name is derived from the greek words necros which means dead and psittakos parrot in reference to the bird being extinct the current whereabouts of the holotype beak are unknown it may be specimen umzc a rostrum that was sent from milne edwards to the english zoologist alfred newton after which matches the drawing and description in milne edwards paper but this cannot be confirmed in the ornithologists edward newton brother of alfred and hans gadow described more fossils of the rodrigues parrot including a skull and limb bones remains of the species are scarce and subfossils have been discovered in caves on the plaine corail and in caverne tortue in the footnotes to his compilation milne edwards correlated the subfossil species with parrots mentioned by leguat in a newton analysed tafforet s then newly rediscovered account and identified a description of the rodrigues parrot therein in a footnote in an edition of leguat s memoir the english writer samuel pasfield oliver doubted that the parrots mentioned were the rodrigues parrot due to their smaller size and suggested they may have been newton s parakeet psittacula exsul as leguat mentioned both green and blue parrots in the same sentence the english palaeontologist julian hume suggested in that these could either be interpreted as references to both the rodrigues parrot and newton s parakeet or as two colour morphs of the latter evolution many endemic mascarene birds including the dodo raphus cucullatus are derived from south asian ancestors and hume has proposed that this may be the case for all the parrots there as well sea levels were lower during the pleistocene so it was possible for species to colonise some of the then less isolated islands although most extinct parrot species of the mascarenes are poorly known subfossil remains show that they shared features such as enlarged heads and jaws reduced pectoral bones and robust leg bones newton and gadow found the rodrigues parrot to be closely related to the broad billed parrot lophopsittacus mauritianus due to their large jaws and other osteological features but were unable to determine whether they both belonged in the same genus since a head crest was only known from the latter the british ornithologist graham s cowles instead found their skulls too dissimilar for them to be close relatives in hume has suggested that the mascarene parrots have a common origin in the radiation of the psittaculini tribe basing this theory on morphological features and the fact that psittacula parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the indian ocean the psittaculini may have invaded the area several times as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the mascarenes emerged from the sea hypothetical extinct relatives the british zoologist walther rothschild assigned two hypothetical parrot species from the other mascarene islands to the necropsittacus genus n francicus in and n borbonicus named for bourbon the original name of r union in n borbonicus was based on a single account by the french traveller sieur dubois who mentioned green parrots of the same size presumably as the r union parakeet psittacula eques eques with head upper parts of the wings and tail the colour of fire on r union rothschild considered it to belong to necropsittacus since dubois compared it with psittacula species which are related rothschild gave the original description of n francicus as head and tail fiery red rest of body and tail green and stated it was based on descriptions from voyages to mauritius in the th and early th century the two assigned necropsittacus species have since become the source of much taxonomic confusion and their identities have been debated n borbonicus later received common names such as r union red and green parakeet or r union parrot and n francicus has been called the mauritian parrot the japanese ornithologist masauji hachisuka recognised n borbonicus in and published a restoration of it with the colouration described by dubois and the body plan of the rodrigues parrot he did not find the naming of n francicus to have been necessary but expressed hope more evidence would be found in the american ornithologist james greenway suggested that n borbonicus may have been an escaped pet lory seen by dubois since th century dutch paintings show the somewhat similar east indian chattering lory lorius garrulus presumably in captivity however greenway was unable to find any references that matched those rothschild had given for n francicus in the british ecologist anthony s cheke found the described colour pattern of n borbonicus remiscent of psittacula parrots but considered n francicus to be based on confused reports in the british writer errol fuller suggested dubois account of n borbonicus could either have referred to an otherwise unrecorded species or have been misleading and found n francicus to be one of the most dubious of all hypothetical species in hume suggested that rothschild had associated n borbonicus with the rodrigues parrot because he had mistakenly incorporated dubois account into his description of the latter he stated the rodrigues parrot also had red plumage though it was all green and had been mentioned by dubois who never visited rodrigues rothschild also attributed the sighting of n francicus to dubois repeating the colour pattern he had described earlier for the rodrigues parrot and this lead hume to conclude that the name n francicus was based solely on the muddled imagination of lord rothschild hume added that if dubois description of n borbonicus was based on a parrot endemic to r union it may have been derived from the alexandrine parakeet psittacula eupatria which has a similar colouration apart from the red tail description the rodrigues parrot was described as being the largest parrot species on the island with a big head and a long tail its plumage was described as being of uniform green colouration its skull was flat and depressed compared to those of most other parrots but similar to the genus ara the skull was mm in long without the beak mm in wide and mm in deep the coracoid part of the shoulder was mm in long the humerus upper arm bone mm in the ulna lower arm bone mm in the femur thigh bone mm in the tibia lower leg bone mm in and the metatarsus foot bone mm in its exact body length is unknown but it may have been around cm in comparable to the size of a large cockatoo its tibia was smaller than that of a female broad billed parrot yet the pectoral bones were of similar size and proportionally its head was the largest of any mascarene species of parrot the skeleton of the rodrigues parrot had similarities with the tanygnathus and psittacula parrot genera the pectoral and pelvic bones were similar in size to those of the new zealand kaka nestor meridionalis and it may have looked similar to the great billed parrot tanygnathus megalorynchos in life but with a larger head and tail it differed from other mascarene parrots in several skeletal features including having nostrils that faced upwards instead of forwards no features of the skull suggest it had a crest like the broad billed parrot and there is not enough fossil evidence to determine whether it had pronounced sexual dimorphism there are intermediate specimens between the longest and shortest examples of the known skeletal elements which indicates there were no distinct size groups behaviour and ecology tafforet s description is the only detailed account of the rodrigues parrot in life the largest are larger than a pigeon and have a tail very long the head large as well as the beak they mostly come on the islets which are to the south of the island where they eat a small black seed which produces a small shrub whose leaves have the smell of the orange tree and come to the mainland to drink water they have their plumage green tafforet also mentioned that the parrots ate the seeds of the fernelia buxifolia shrub bois de buis which is endangered today but was common all over rodrigues and nearby islets during his visit due to a large population of introduced rats on rodrigues the parrots the rodrigues starling necropsar rodericanus and the rodrigues pigeon nesoenas rodericanus frequented and nested on offshore islets where the rats were absent many other of the endemic species of rodrigues became extinct after the arrival of humans so the ecosystem of the island is heavily damaged before humans arrived forests covered the island entirely but very little remains today due to deforestation the rodrigues parrot lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the rodrigues solitaire pezophaps solitaria the rodrigues rail erythromachus leguati newton s parakeet the rodrigues starling the rodrigues owl mascarenotus murivorus the rodrigues night heron nycticorax megacephalus and the rodrigues pigeon extinct reptiles include the domed rodrigues giant tortoise

mascarenes only the echo parakeet psittacula eques echo of mauritius has survived the others were likely all made extinct by a combination of excessive hunting and deforestation by humans like mainland rodrigues the offshore islets were eventually infested by rats as well and this is believed to be the reason for the demise of the rodrigues parrot and other birds there the rats probably preyed on their eggs and chicks pingr indicated that local species were popular game and found that the rodrigues parrot was rare the perruche newton s parakeet seemed to me much more delicate than the flying fox i would not have missed any game from france if this one had been commoner in rodrigues but it begins to become rare there are even fewer perroquets rodrigues parrots although there were once a big enough quantity according to fran ois leguat indeed a little islet south of rodrigues still retains the name isle of parrots isle pierrot pingr also reported that the island was becoming deforested by tortoise hunters who set fires to clear vegetation along with direct hunting of the parrots this likely led to a reduction in the population of rodrigues parrots pingr s account is the last known mention of the species and it probably became extinct soon after references external links media related to necropsittacus rodricanus at wikimedia commons data related to

en,ray of light is the seventh studio album by american singer madonna it was released on february by maverick and warner bros records after giving birth to her first child madonna started working on the album with producers babyface and patrick leonard following failed sessions with them madonna pursued a new musical direction with english producer william orbit the recording took place over four months and experienced problems with orbit s hardware arrangement which would break down and recording would have to be delayed until they could be repaired a departure from her previous work ray of light is an electronica dance and techno pop album which incorporates multiple genres including ambient trip hop and house music vocally the album saw madonna sing with greater breadth and a fuller tone mystical themes are also strongly present in both the music and lyrics as a result of madonna embracing kabbalah her study of hinduism and buddhism as well as her daily practice of hatha yoga the album received universal acclaim with reviews commending the singer s new musical direction called her most adventurous record ray of light has been noted for its mature restrained nature reviewers also praised madonna s vocals ray of light won four grammy awards from a total of six nominations commercially the album peaked at number one in many countries such as australia canada germany and the united kingdom on the us billboard the album debuted and peaked at number two with the biggest first week sales by a female artist at the time ray of light has sold more than million copies worldwide five singles were released from the album including the international hits frozen and ray of light the album s promotion was later supported by the drowned world tour in academics noted the album s influence on popular music and how it introduced electronica into mainstream pop culture they also noted madonna s musical re invention with the album which helped her remain contemporary among the teenage artists of the period ray of light has been ranked among lists of greatest albums of all time background following the release of her compilation album something to remember madonna started taking vocal lessons in preparation for her role in evita she also gave birth to her daughter lourdes the same year these events inspired a period of introspection that was a big catalyst for me it took me on a search for answers to questions i d never asked myself before she said to q magazine in during the same period she embraced kabbalah and started studying hinduism and yoga all of which helped her step outside myself and see the world from a different perspective madonna felt that there was a whole piece of her voice left unused which she decided to utilize for the album by may madonna had started writing songs for the album she began collaborating with babyface who had first worked with her on her previous album bedtime stories the two wrote a couple of songs together before madonna decided the collaborations were not going in the musical direction she wanted for the album according to babyface the songs had a take a bow ish kind of vibe and madonna didn t want or need to repeat herself after abandoning the songs she had written with babyface madonna turned to musician rick nowels who had previously co written songs with stevie nicks and celine dion the collaboration produced seven songs in nine days but those songs also did not display the album s future electronic musical direction three of the songs the power of good bye to have and not to hold and little star appear on the album madonna then began writing songs with leonard who had produced many songs for madonna in the late s unlike her previous albums leonard s song writing collaborations were accompanied by very little studio input madonna believed that leonard s production would have lent the songs more of a peter gabriel vibe a sound that she did not want for the album guy oseary chairman of maverick records then phoned british electronic musician william orbit and suggested that he send some songs to madonna orbit sent a track digital audio tape to madonna i was a huge fan of william s earlier records strange cargo and and all that i also loved all the remixes he did for me and i was interested in fusing a kind of futuristic sound but also using lots of indian and moroccan influences and things like that and i wanted it to sound old and new at the same time madonna said recording in early june before starting recording orbit met madonna at her house in new york and she played him the music she had worked on with other producers up to may which he felt sounded slick they visited the hit factory later that week where madonna invited the producer to work on ray of light orbit then sent her a tape of musical snippets he was working on which were usually eight or sixteen bar phrases and stripped down versions of tracks that would later be heard on the album madonna listened to the samples over and over again until she was inspired to write lyrics once she had an idea about the lyrical direction of the song she would take her ideas back to orbit and they would expand on the original music ideas as most of the tracks pre existed madonna worked on the lyrics while at home or while travelling the album was recorded over four and a half months at larrabee north studio in north hollywood california beginning in mid june the longest madonna had ever worked on an album for most of the recording process only three other people were in the studio with madonna william orbit an engineer named pat mccarthy and his assistant engineer matt silva they started recording in los angeles but the recording process was initially plagued with machinery problems as orbit preferred to work with samples synth sounds and pro tools and not with live musicians the computers would break down and recording would have to be delayed until they could be repaired orbit recorded the bulk of the album s instrumentation over a four month period orbit recalls playing the guitar and having his fingers bleed during the long hours he spent in the studio after some errors in her pronunciation of sanskrit shloka yoga taravali during the song shanti ashtangi the bbc arranged for madonna to take telephonic lessons to learn the basic correct pronunciation of sanskrit words from eminent scholar dr b p t vagish shastri she then made the necessary pronunciation corrections on the album in an interview with mtv madonna recalled the recording of the album and said her business partner guy oseary was a helpful friend and that after she and orbit played him the tracks he to their dismay said nothing and left the studio he really hates those icy strings right when i think the track s done he sort of pushes us another step further maybe we should try this or i really don t want to hear that and then of course later on it creeps in my brain and i m like maybe i should have done a background vocal on that and then she comes in and happily does it right madonna said orbit also recalled during an interview with q magazine that madonna recorded swim the day her friend and fashion designer gianni versace was killed in miami florida he also commented that this is probably why the track has an emotional impact title and artwork according to spokesperson liz rosenberg madonna considered titling the album mantra which she thought was a really cool title however she changed the title to ray of light as her albums were always titled after one of the songs from that album the artwork was shot by peruvian photographer mario testino on november in a studio in golden beach florida they had previously collaborated for a versace brand collection in madonna was impressed with the natural look testino had captured so she booked him again for the album s photoshoot he recalled at pm she said ok i m tired we re done and i said but i don t have the pictures yet she said you re working for me and i say we re done i said no we carry on the picture she used on the cover came after that composition ray of light was a notable departure from madonna s previous work and has been described as her most adventurous record an electronica dance and techno pop album it also contains elements of several different types of music including house ambient trip hop drum and bass rock new wave eastern and classical music vocally the album was also a marked change from madonna s previous work as the singer underwent vocal training lessons for her film evita her vocals exhibited greater breadth and range as well as a fuller timbre in many songs she also abandoned the vibrato which was present in her previous work critically it is said to have madonna s most full bodied vocals the album s opening track and third single drowned world substitute for love is a downtempo ballad drawing influences from jungle drum and bass and trip hop music the title is inspired by j g ballard s post apocalyptic science fiction novel the drowned world swim the second song has a spiritual tone she sings swim to the ocean floor so that we can begin again wash away all our sins crash to the other shore ray of light the third track and album s second single is an up tempo electronic dance pop song which contains strong techno tendencies and influences of trance music a sonically progressive track it also incorporates elements of rock music with a prominent electric guitar riff the melody also has several sound effects including whistles and bleeps candy perfume girl

over the beats of an electronic orchestra the sixth track nothing really matters is an up tempo dance track which contains influences of techno sky fits heaven focuses on madonna s spiritual studies and her daughter lourdes some lyrics include sky fits heaven so fly it that s what the prophet said to me child fits mother so hold your baby tight that s what my future can see elements of the lyric are taken from the poem what fits by poet max blagg the poem used for a advertisement for gap inc shanti ashtangi is a hindu sanskrit prayer and up tempo techno song sung by madonna with an indian accent over a driving dance rhythm the techno dance track features madonna singing the adapted version of shankaracharya entirely in sanskrit with lines such as vunde gurunam caranaravinde sandarsita svatma sukhavabodhe frozen the ninth track and album s first single is a mid tempo electronic ballad which has a layered sound enhanced by synthesizers and strings the song additionally contains ambient qualities a moderate dance rhythm during the chorus and techno influenced beats towards the end madonna s vocals throughout the song lack vibrato and have drawn comparisons to medieval music lyrically the song is about a cold and emotionless man nevertheless subtexts have been noticed according to jarman ivens lyrics such as you re frozen when your heart s not open reflected an artistic palette encompassing diverse musical textual and visual styles in its lyrics the power of good bye is an emotional ballad which lyrically meditates on loss and longing it was released as the album s fourth single to have and not to hold is about a distant lover and little star is about her daughter lourdes both are superficially vibrant but with underlying subtlety and restrained arrangements

light madonna s most adventurous record and her most mature and restrained album in his review he gave the album four and a half out of five stars paul verna from billboard commented easily her most mature and personal work to date ray of light finds madonna weaving lyrics with the painstaking intimacy of diary entries and wrapping them in hymn like melodies and instrumentation swathed in lush melancholy ambience with forays into classic house trance and even guitar pop of course she balances the set s serious tone with chewy pop nuggets that allow her to flex her immeasurably widened vocal range to fine effect he finished the review by calling the album a deliciously adventurous ultimately victorious effort from one of pop music s most compelling performers sal cinquemani of slant magazine described the album as one of the great pop masterpieces of the s and stated that its lyrics are uncomplicated but its statement is grand and madonna hasn t been this emotionally candid since like a prayer sheffield s review for rolling stone called the album brilliant but was critical of orbit s production saying that he doesn t know enough tricks to produce a whole album and so becomes

mother makeover to especially her music ray of light is truly like a prayer and you know she ll take you there roni sarig in a review for city pages was most impressed by madonna s vocal range depth and clarity and called ray of light her richest most accomplished record yet music critic robert hilburn from los angeles times wrote one reason why her new ray of light is the most satisfying album of her career is that it reflects the soul searching of a woman who is at a point in her life where she can look at herself with surprising candor and perspective writing for melody maker in february mark roland drew comparisons with the music of st etienne and bj rk s homogenic album highlighting ray of light s lack of cynicism as its most positive aspect it s not an album turned on the lathe of cynical pop manipulation rather it s been squished out of a lump of clay on a foot powered wheel lovingly teased into life ray of light is like the ugly mug that doesn t match but is all the more special because of it joan anderman from the boston globe said that ray of light is a remarkable album he described it as a deeply spiritual dance record ecstatically textured a serious cycle of songs that goes a long way toward liberating madonna from a career built on scavenged images and cultivated identities robert christgau was less impressed in playboy deeming ray of light a great sounding

university observed that ray of light made south asian culture accessible to the american public in the s rhonda hammer and douglas kellner in their book media cultural studies critical approaches recalled that the phenomenon of south asian inspired femininity as a western media trend can be traced to february when pop icon madonna released her video frozen they explained that although madonna did not initiate the fashion for indian beauty accessories she did propel it into the public eye by attracting the attention of the worldwide media according to taraborrelli the album has been hailed as bold and refreshing in contemporary music of the late s which was dominated by boybands and teenage artists such as the backstreet boys nsync britney spears and christina aguilera larry flick from billboard said that the album not only provided the chameleon like artist with her first universally applauded critical success it has also proved that she remains a vital figure amongst woefully fickle young audiences music critic lucy o brien commented s ray of light certainly rehabilitated madonna s image up to that point she had still been written off as an average pop glamour girl who got lucky but with this record she reached a whole new audience proving that she was a good songwriter with an intensely productive talent mary von aue from stereogum stated that ray of light reestablished madonna as a groundbreaking artist ray of light continued to influence mainstream music when british singer and songwriter adele stated that the album was one of the main sources of inspiration for her third studio album particularly frozen was a source of inspiration as well admitting that the track gave her confidence to come and do me again adele further added that ray of light was madonna s best album and found several comparisons between herself and madonna during that stage of her life due to its impact on popular music ray of light has been featured on numerous

en,the douglas a invader designated b between and is an american twin engined light bomber and ground attack aircraft built by douglas aircraft company during world war ii the invader also saw service during several major cold war conflicts a limited number of highly modified united states air force aircraft served in southeast asia until it was a fast aircraft capable of carrying a large bomb load a range of guns could be fitted to produce a formidable ground attack aircraft a re designation of the type from a to b led to confusion with the martin b marauder which first flew in november some months before the douglas design s maiden flight although both types were powered by the widely used pratt whitney r double wasp eighteen cylinder double row radial engine they were completely different and separate designs the martin bomber originated in with more than twice as many marauders nearly produced in comparison to the douglas design design and development the a was douglas aircraft s successor to the a db havoc also known as douglas boston one of the most successful and widely operated types flown by allied air forces in world war ii designed by ed heinemann robert donovan and ted r smith the innovative naca laminar flow airfoil wing of the a was the work of project aerodynamicist a m o smith the douglas xa prototype aac ser no first flew on july at mines field el segundo with test pilot benny howard at the controls flight tests revealed excellent performance and handling but engine cooling problems led to cowling changes and elimination of the propeller spinners on production aircraft repeated collapses during testing led to reinforcement of the nose landing gear the a was originally built in two different configurations the a b had a gun nose which originally could be equipped with a combination of armament including caliber machine guns mm or mm auto cannon or even a mm pack howitzer which was never used operationally normally the gun nose version housed six or later eight caliber machine guns officially termed the all purpose nose later commonly known as the six gun nose or eight gun nose the a c s glass nose officially termed the bombardier nose contained a norden bombsight for medium altitude precision bombing the a c nose section included two fixed m guns later replaced by underwing gun packs or internal guns in the wings after about production aircraft three guns were installed in each wing coinciding with the introduction of the eight gun nose for a bs giving some configurations as many as in mm machine guns in fixed forward mounts an a c nose section could be replaced with an a b nose section or vice versa in a few man hours thus physically and officially changing the designation and operational role the flat topped canopy was changed in late after about production aircraft to a clamshell style with greatly improved visibility alongside the pilot in an a b a crew member typically served as navigator and gun loader for the pilot operated nose guns in an a c that crew member served as navigator and bombardier and relocated to the nose section for the bombing phase of an operation a small number of a cs were fitted with dual flight controls some parts of which could be disabled in flight to allow limited access to the nose section access was through the lower section of the right hand instrument panel which was open to allow access to the nose for the bombardier who would normally sit next to the pilot this was similar to british designs like the lancaster blenheim beaufort wellington etc a tractor style jump seat was located behind the navigator s seat in most missions a third crew member in the rear gunner s compartment operated the remotely controlled dorsal and ventral gun turrets with access to and from the cockpit possible via the bomb bay only when that was empty the gunner operated both dorsal and ventral turrets via a novel and complex and problematic dual ended periscope sight which was a vertical column running through the center of the rear compartment with traversing and elevating depressing periscope sights on each end the gunner sat on a seat facing rearward and looked into a binocular periscope sight mounted on the column controlling the guns with a pair of handles on either side of the column when aiming above the centerline of the aircraft the mirror in the center of the column would flip showing the gunner what the upper periscope was seeing when he pressed the handles downward as the bead passed the centerline the mirror would automatically flip transferring the sight seamlessly to the lower periscope the guns would aim wherever the periscope was aimed automatically transferring between upper and lower turrets as required and computing for parallax and other factors while novel and theoretically effective a great deal of time and trouble was spent trying to get the system to work effectively which delayed production and it was difficult to keep maintained in the field even once production started operational history world war ii pacific the douglas company began delivering the production model a b to the united states army air forces usaaf in august with the new bomber first seeing action with the fifth air force in the southwest pacific theater on june when japanese held islands near manokwari were attacked the pilots in the rd bomb group s th squadron the grim reapers who received the first four a s for evaluation found the view from the cockpit to be restricted by the engines and thus inadequate for low level attack general george kenney commander of the far east air forces stated that we do not want the a under any circumstances as a replacement for anything until changes could be made the d bomb group requested additional douglas a havocs although both types were used in composite flights the th bomb group worked up on the a in march joining the initial rd bg with the th flying until august the a operations wound down in mid august with only a few dozen missions flown several of the a and b aaf units in the pacific received the a for trials in limited quantities europe douglas needed better results from the invader s second combat test so a s began arriving in europe in late september for assignment to the ninth air force the initial deployment involved aircraft and crews assigned to the d squadron of the th bomb group this unit flew its first mission on september no aircraft were lost on the eight test missions and the ninth air force announced that it was happy to replace all of its a s and b s with the a invader the first group to fully convert to the a b was th bombardment group with which it entered combat on november and the th bombardment group whose a s became operational in late november due to a shortage of a c variants the groups flew a combined a a unit until deliveries of the glass nose version caught up besides bombing and strafing tactical reconnaissance and night interdiction missions were undertaken successfully in contrast to the pacific based units the a was well received by pilots and crew alike and by the th af had flown missions dropping tons of bombs recording seven confirmed kills while losing aircraft in italy the twelfth air force s th bomb group also received the a starting in january they were used against german transport links but also for direct support and interdiction against tanks and troop concentrations in the po valley in the final campaigns in italy postwar era united states with the establishment of the united states air force as an independent service in the strategic air command operated the now redesignated b as an rb reconnaissance aircraft in service from through u s air forces in europe continued operating the redesignated b until and the tactical air command operated the aircraft as both a b and later redesignated back to a the final variant designated as b k until when it again became the a a this final version continued in service through the late s with active duty special operations tac units and through with tac gained special operations units of the air national guard the u s navy also obtained a number of invaders from the air force and employed these aircraft in their utility squadrons vu for target towing and general utility use until superseded by the dc a variant of the c hercules the navy designation was jd and jd d until when the jd was redesignated ub j and the jd d was redesignated db j the cia also used the type for covert operations the last a in active u s service was assigned to the air national guard that aircraft being retired from military service in by the u s air force and the national guard bureau and donated to the national air and space museum korean war b invaders of the d bombardment group operating from bases in southern japan were among the first usaf aircraft engaged in the korean war carrying out missions over south korea on and june before carrying out the first usaf bombing mission on north korea on june when they bombed an airfield outside of pyongyang on august the air force reserve s d bombardment wing was activated for korean service it flew its first missions in november from itazuke japan providing daylight support with the rd bomb wing consisting of the th th and th bomb squadrons flying night missions because of the chinese intervention it was forced to find another base and moved to miho air base on the west coast of honsh in early it moved to pusan east k air base and continued its daylight as well as night intruder missions in june it joined the rd bomb wing kunsan k in night activity only dividing the target areas with the nd taking the eastern half and the rd the western for its efforts in the korean war it was awarded two unit citations and the korean presidential citation it also received credit for eight campaign operations in may it was inactivated and all of its aircraft and equipment along

vehicles locomotives railway trucks and seven enemy aircraft on the ground on september captain john s walmsley jr attacked a supply train when his guns jammed he illuminated the target with his searchlight to enable his wingmen to destroy the train walmsley was shot down and posthumously awarded the medal of honor invaders carried out the last usaf bombing mission of the war minutes before the armistice agreement was signed on june in addition to the standard attack versions of the b which flew night interdiction missions a small number of modified wb s and rb s of the th tactical reconnaissance wing flew critical weather observation and reconnaissance missions in supporting roles southeast asia the first b s to arrive in southeast asia were deployed to takhli rtafb thailand in december these unmarked aircraft operated under the auspices of the u s cia central intelligence agency were soon augmented by an additional aircraft b bs and b cs plus four rb cs under operation millpond the mission of all of these aircraft was to assist the royal lao government in fighting the pathet lao the repercussions from the bay of pigs invasion meant that no combat missions are known to have been flown although rb cs operated over laos until the end of the aircraft were subsequently operated in south vietnam under project farm gate the only other deployment of b aircraft to laos prior to the introduction of the b k a a was the deployment of two rb c aircraft specifically modified for night reconnaissance deployed to laos between may and july under project black watch these aircraft initially drawn from farm gate stocks were returned upon the end of these missions the aircraft from laos participated in the early phase of the vietnam war with the usaf but with vietnamese markings as part of project farm gate though farm gate operated b bs b cs and genuine rb cs many of these aircraft were operated under the designation rb c though they were used in a combat capacity during two rb c were sent to clark ab in the philippines for modifications though not with night systems as with those modified for black watch the two aircraft returned from black watch to farm gate were subsequently given the designation rb l to distinguish them from other modified rb c and were assigned to project sweet sue farm gate s b s operated alongside the other primary strike aircraft of the time the t trojan before both aircraft types were replaced by the douglas a skyraider the b s were withdrawn from service in february after two accidents related to wing spar fatigue one during combat in southeast asia in august and one during an airpower demonstration at eglin afb florida in february on february two pilots from the st air commando wing stationed at hurlburt field fla died in the crash of a b on range at eglin afb when it lost a wing during pull out from a strafing pass the aircraft was participating in a demonstration of the special air warfare center s counter insurgency capabilities and had completed a strafing run when the accident occurred sawc had presented the demonstration on an average of twice each month for the previous months b aircraft used by usaf commandos in vietnam were grounded april following an official investigation into the february accident b aircraft in use by the south vietnamese air force were also grounded in accordance with the u s ruling in response to this the on mark engineering company of van nuys california was selected by the air force to extensively upgrade the invader for a counterinsurgency role the first production flight of the b k was on may at the van nuys airport on mark converted invaders to the new b k counter invader standard which included upgraded engines propellers and brakes re manufactured wings and wing tip fuel tanks for use by the th special operations squadron in may the b k was re designated a a for political reasons thailand did not allow the u s to have bombers stationed in

de,wut auch lateinisch furor raserei leidenschaft wahnsinn oder französisch rage a raserei zorn toben ist eine sehr heftige emotion und häufig eine impulsive und aggressive reaktion affekt die durch eine als unangenehm empfundene situation oder bemerkung z b eine kränkung ausgelöst worden ist wut ist heftiger als der ärger und schwerer zu beherrschen als der zorn wer häufig in wut gerät gilt als wüterich implizit ist damit ausgesagt wer leicht in wut gerät ist weniger gut imstande sich selbst zu kontrollieren die ableitung des italienischen furore für rasenden beifall sowie leidenschaftlichkeit wird im zusammenhang mit furore machen als großes aufsehen erregen und beifall erringen definiert sicht der psychologie psychologen grenzen die wut von zorn und ärger ab indem sie von einem höheren erregungsniveau und stärkerer intensität sprechen von zorn spricht man dann wenn die angelegenheit die uns ärgert nicht primär auf unser ich bezogen ist sondern auf etwas übergreifendes der zorn ist etwas distanzierter als die wut verena kast vom sinn des ärgers die entstehung von wut wird psychologisch analog zur entstehung von aggressionen erklärt dazu gibt es im wesentlichen drei theorien die triebtheorie nach sigmund freud sie geht von einem angeborenen aggressionstrieb aus wird er prinzipiell unterdrückt kommt es zu seelischen störungen die frustrations aggressions theorie geht davon aus dass aggressionen grundsätzlich reaktionen auf frustration sind wut ist demnach eine abreaktion die lerntheorie nach albert bandura stellt aggression als erlerntes verhalten dar sie sei ein verhaltensmuster das durch bestimmte erfahrungen und das lernen von vorbildern antrainiert werde es gibt in der psychologie jedoch auch übergreifende ansätze in denen mehrere erklärungen aufgegriffen werden die äußerungen von wut und aggression gehen nach rainer schandry s u in den grundelementen auf genetische fundierungen zurück bei der ausgestaltung der wutausbrüche in bestimmten konkreten situationen jedoch auf lernvorgänge und kognitive prozesse form und art der wutausbrüche das konkrete verhalten eines wutausbruchs orientieren sich demnach an sozialen normen und vorbildern die sich in verschiedenen gesellschaften und gesellschaftsarealen unterschiedlich entwickeln können wutanfall allgemeines unter wutanfall versteht man einen meist kurzzeitigen partiellen oder völligen verlust der kontrolle über das gefühl der wut man spricht hier vom affekt wutanfälle richten sich gegen personen tiere institutionen oder auch sachen und haben oft einen konkreten auslöser der aber nicht zwangsläufig identisch mit dem ziel der damit verbundenen attacke sein muss der wutanfall wird auch als überreaktion bezeichnet und gilt deshalb in den meisten kulturkreisen als charakterschwäche analog gilt es oft als charakterstärke sich nicht aus der ruhe bringen zu lassen sondern die contenance zu wahren bzw kühl zu bleiben prinzipiell kann in ausnahmesituationen und unter starkem stress jeder mensch einen wutanfall erleiden wobei jedoch eine neigung zu solchen bei erwachsenen als cholerisch gilt bei kleinkindern gehören wutanfälle in einer bestimmten phase zur psychischen entwicklung wutanfälle sind auch typisch für einige psychische störungen wie beim hospitalismus deprivationssyndrom bei autismus kanner syndrom oder asperger syndrom hier treten wutanfälle außergewöhnlich oft überdurchschnittlich lang und meist auch sehr intensiv auf auch bei geistig behinderten menschen kommt es leichter zu wutanfällen da deren fähigkeit zur kontrolle und verarbeitung so starker emotionen oft eingeschränkt ist ein wutanfall kann absichtlich oder unabsichtlich evoziert werden dazu genügen oft schon kleine reizworte oder handlungen die für sich genommen eigentlich keine bedeutung hätten die redewendung jemanden auf die palme bringen beschreibt dies bildlich neben dem externen auslöser gibt es auch die möglichkeit sich selbst in einen wutanfall zu steigern wutanfälle beim kind bei kindern im alter von ein bis vier jahren sind wutanfälle ein weit verbreitetes und normales verhalten enttäuschungen führen bei vielen kindern in dieser altersgruppe zu eskalierenden körperlichen und verbalen reaktionen wie sich auf den boden werfen weinen schreien treten schlagen und werfen von objekten müdigkeit und hunger können das verhalten verstärken in elternratgebern wird meist empfohlen wutanfälle zu ignorieren ruhe zu bewahren und das kind selbstbeherrschung durch ein gutes vorbild zu lehren wenn kinder die erfahrung machen dass sie sich mit wutanfällen wirkungsvoll durchsetzen können diese zu einer erlernten angewohnheit werden der amerikanische kinderarzt william sears unterscheidet allerdings zwischen manipulativen wutanfällen einerseits die durch nichtbeachtung entmutigt werden sollten und enttäuschungs wutanfällen andererseits in denen das kind wirklich trost und zuspruch benötigt um die aufgabe an der es zu scheitern fürchtet doch noch zu bewältigen in vielen elternratgebern werden nicht nur techniken des krisenmanagements beschrieben sondern auch methoden der prävention und der frühzeitigen deeskalation sich anbahnender wutanfälle in vielen schulen wird heutzutage ein training gepflegt in dem kinder lernen konflikte verbal auszutragen lässt das verhalten mit dem heranreifen besonders mit der entfaltung der verbalisationsfähigkeit nicht nach oder besteht über das vierte lebensjahr hinaus fort so könnte es sich chronifiziert haben oder auf eine der diagnostik bedürftige störung hinweisen und ein kinderpsychologe sollte zu rate gezogen werden umgang mit wut die wut gilt in den meisten kulturkreisen als verwerflich und ist gesellschaftlich nicht akzeptiert sie entspricht nicht dem erwarteten sozialverhalten dennoch hilft sie in vielen fällen den willen durchzusetzen wissenschaftliche studien zeigen dass häufig unterdrückte wut krankheiten hervorrufen kann vergleichbar mit ständiger belastung durch stress als beobachtete gesundheitsfolgen werden unter anderem erhöhter cholesterinspiegel bluthochdruck erhöhtes herzinfarktrisiko und erkrankungen des herz kreislauf systems genannt dennoch vermindert das ständige ausleben von aggressionen das risiko nicht die genannten erkrankungen zu erleiden im gegenteil es nimmt sogar zu die erklärung dafür ist dass ärger die produktion von adrenalin und noradrenalin steigert also von stresshormonen diese haben unter anderem einfluss auf die blutgerinnung manche psychologen gehen davon aus dass unterdrückte wut eine ursache von depressionen essstörungen und alkoholismus ist in der ratgeberliteratur wird häufig empfohlen wut angemessen auszudrücken oder zu kanalisieren etwa durch sport gespräche imaginationen kreativen

de,die templerprozesse sind eine reihe von kirchlichen und weltlichen gerichtsverfahren die seitens der französischen krone initiiert wurden und mit der auflösung des templerordens durch päpstlichen erlass endeten chronologie der diversen verfahren und ihre hintergründe die verhaftung und das erste verfahren der prozess gegen die templer nahm seinen anfang im königreich frankreich philippe iv hatte die verhaftung der templer in seinem reich in übereinstimmung mit seinem rat am september beschlossen das mit dem fest der kreuzerhöhung zusammenfällt briefe wurden zu allen vasallen und beamten des königreichs gesandt die genaue anordnungen für die am freitag dem oktober geplante polizeiaktion enthielten in seinem arrestationsbefehl stützt sich könig philippe iv auf gerüchte und denunziationen durch die er sich gezwungen gesehen habe zu reagieren das schreiben spricht von einem vehementen verdacht der häresie und präzisiert die vier ersten anklagepunkte gegen die templer die erklärung des vehementen verdachtes und die damit ausgesprochene infamie rechtfertigte seit dem jahrhundert die eröffnung eines kanonischen verfahrens das so veröffentlichte faktum der infamie beinhaltete gleichzeitig die exkommunikation des beschuldigten damit schuf der könig ein präjudiz noch vor der eigentlichen prozesseröffnung gegen die privilegien des ordens und auch gegen das kirchenrecht verstoßend fanden die ersten verhöre der ordensbruder vor beamten des königs statt nur einige protokolle dieses ersten verfahrens sind erhalten aus beaucaire bigorre caen cahors carcassonne und n mes die ersten anklageartikel und ihre wahrscheinlichen ursprüngeder arrestationsbefehl für die templer erlassen durch den französischen könig philipp iv im september enthielt die ersten anklagepunkte während ihrer professzeremonie sollen die ordensbrüder dreimal christus verleugnen dreimal auf ein kruzifix spucken sich einen dreifachen kuss erteilen auf das ende des rückgrates den nabel und den mund sich mit ihrem gelübde zur homosexualität verpflichten dieser punkt wurde damit dass auf dem templersiegel zwei ritter auf einem pferd saßen verstärkt die templer wollten damit ausdrücken dass sie in armut zu leben pflegten wie der name des ordens schon zum ausdruck bringt doch man beschuldigte die ritter dass dies homosexualität ausdrücken sollte und überdies hätten sie gott verlassen und dämonen angebetet dies sind die anschuldigungen die das gesamte mittelalter hindurch in literarischen und historischen werken gegen die moslems erhoben werden jene so wurde behauptet zwängen ihre christlichen gefangenen ihren glauben zu verleugnen und auf das kreuz zu spucken und praktizierten dies auch selbst diese anschuldigungen gegen die moslems in der zeit der kreuzzüge mögen zum teil der historischen wahrheit entsprechen die anklage der götzenverehrung ist jedoch rein legendär man findet außerdem parallelen zwischen den gegen die templer erhobenen anklagepunkten und denen gegen papst bonifaz viii die ebenfalls auf geheiß philipps fabriziert wurden die beschuldigung der unsittlichen küsse stammt vermutlich aus dem volksglauben wo erzählungen über analküsse als zeichen des lehnseides an den teufel im umlauf waren aber vielleicht ist dieser punkt auch eine einfache verkehrung allgemeiner liturgischer praktiken die den mundkuss und einen kuss auf die brust als zeichen des friedens kannten diese ersten anklageartikel bildeten die verhörgrundlage in den ersten beiden verfahren des prozesses philipp iv hatte seinen gendarmen befohlen besonders auf dem geständnis der verleugnung christi zu insistieren wenn nötig mit hilfe der folter die hinzuziehung der inquisition und das problem des summarischen verfahrens in einem zweiten verfahrensgang wurde ab dem oktober die inquisition hinzugezogen einige fragmente der in chaumont troyes und renneville aufgenommen protokolle sind überliefert die gefangenen im temple von paris deren protokolle ebenfalls noch existieren gestanden alle außer fünf brüdern die ihnen vorgeworfenen verbrechen am oktober fand das erste verhör des meisters jacques de molay durch den dominikanischen inquisitor guillaume imbert ebenfalls in paris statt während dieser ersten beiden verfahren wandte man einen verfahrensmodus an der noch nicht genau definiert war und der später summarisches verfahren genannt werden sollte und in dem die rechte der angeklagten im vergleich zu traditionellen prozessformen starken einschränkungen unterworfen wurden die noch existierenden protokolle weisen starke parallelen zwischen den einzelnen geständnissen auf jedoch nur im lokalen rahmen einer protokollserie demhingegen sind aussagen ein und derselben person in den verschiedenen verfahren unterschiedlich ursache dieser parallelen ist die praxis der verhörführung und die formalisierung der protokolle innerhalb des jeweiligen verfahrens der protest papst clemens v und die bulle pastoralis präeminentie am oktober protestierte papst clemens gegen die verhaftung der templer die angewandte folter und die einziehung der güter am oktober ließ könig philippe iv den meister jacques de molay und einige andere brüder vor einer versammlung von prälaten und doktoren der universität auftreten der meister erkannte öffentlich sämtliche dem orden vorgeworfenen verbrechen an und siegelte sogar ein schreiben mit dem er alle templer aufforderte zu gestehen die gründe dieser handlung sind unbekannt möglicherweise wollte jacques de molay seine mitbrüder vor weiterer folter schützen darauf vertrauend dass der papst das unrechtmäßige verfahren ohnehin für null und nichtig erklären würde die folgenden wochen vergingen mit geheimen verhandlungen von clemens v und könig philippe sie endeten am november mit der bulle pastoralis praeeminentiae die die verhaftung der templer nunmehr in allen ländern aber auch deren überstellung an die kirche anordnete papst clemens sandte zwei kardinäle nach paris damit sie das verfahren neu aufrollten vor ihnen widerriefen sowohl jacques de molay als auch die übrigen großwürdenträger hugues de pairaud visitator von frankreich godefrois de charny provinzmeister der normandie und godefrois de gonneville provinzmeister des poitou ihre vorigen geständnisse zu beginn des jahres suspendierte papst clemens die gewalt der inquisitoren in der templerangelegenheit mit der begründung ihres nicht autorisierten und voreiligen eingreifens könig philippe versuchte daraufhin sich von den doktoren der universität die theoretische grundlage seines eingreifens zu beschaffen darüber hinaus berief er die generalstände nach tours ein auf die unterstützung des bürgertums bauend durch die propaganda des königs quasi selbst mit einer anklage wegen unterstützung der häresie bedroht stimmte der papst am mai einer verhandlung mit philippe iv zu das verfahren in poitiers vom juni bis zum juli fand das dritte verfahren des templerprozesses statt hierbei wurden durch die agenten des königs ausgewählte templer aus dem ganzen königreich dem papst und einer kardinalskommission vorgeführt die mitglieder dieser kommission pierre bischof von palestrina b ranger fr dol der ältere bischof von b ziers sowie thomas de sainte sabine tienne de suisy landulph und pietro colonna saßen den verhören getrennt vor protokolle sind überliefert sie enthalten die geständnisse von servienten ordensmitgliedern nicht adliger ritterlicher abstammung gliederten sich in kämpfer und handwerker unterlagen derselben regel wie die ritterbrüder unter ihnen drei komture ritter unter ihnen komture und bereits aus dem orden ausgestoßene ehemalige templer unter ihnen ein priester im textvergleich bieten die geständnisse kein homogenes bild da sich die zeugen weitestgehend an ihren früheren vor den beamten des königs oder der inquisition abgelegten geständnissen orientierten in den fällen wo jene noch erhalten sind sind mit diesen übereinstimmungen festzustellen denn nur wenn die zeugen ihre früheren geständnisse wiederholten hob man die auf ihnen lastende exkommunikation auf der meister und die würdenträger wurden in der burg von chinon eingekerkert und im august desselben jahres ebenfalls durch die kardinäle befragt nach dieser farce schien der papst von den verbrechen des ordens überzeugt gewesen zu sein jedenfalls hob er die suspension der inquisition auf und befahl den kanonischen prozess gegen die templer und ihren orden mit der bulle subit assidue von da an oblag es den bischöfen und erzbischöfen der einzelnen kirchenprovinzen auf diözesankonzilien gegen die personen des ordens vorzugehen die untersuchung gegen den orden als organisation wurde einer anderen päpstlichen kommission übergeben die bulle faciens misericordiam veröffentlicht am august enthielt eine detaillierte liste mit neuen anklageartikeln und exakte anweisungen für die arbeit der diözesankommissionen am selben tag berief clemens v mit der bulle regnans in caelis für das jahr ein allgemeines konzil nach vienne ein die päpstliche kommission von paris und die verteidigung des ordens die päpstliche kommission zur untersuchung gegen den orden als gesamtheit konstituierte sich parallel zu den diözesankommissionen die auf bistumsebene gegen die einzelnen personen des ordens vorgehen sollten in paris ihre mitglieder waren gilles aycelin erzbischof von narbonne guillaume durant bischof von mende raynald de laporte bischof von limoges guillaume de trie bischof von bayeux matthäus von neapel apostolischer notar johannes von mantua erzdiakon von trient jean de montlaur erzdiakon von maguelonne und guillaume agarni propst des domkapitels von aix en provence nicht allein die templer sondern alle personen die eine aussage machen wollten sind diesmal durch öffentliche zitation vor die päpstliche kommission geladen zum ersten mal ist auch eine verteidigung eingefordert aber erst im frühjahr werden die beiden bullen in alle länder ausgesandt aufgrund von kompetenzstreitigkeiten und der verspäteten bekanntmachung der vorladung an die templer selbst beginnt die päpstliche kommission erst im november mit ihrer arbeit am november fand das erste verhör von jacques de molay vor der kommission statt er erklärte sich bereit den orden zu verteidigen und bat um die notwendigen mittel für diese verteidigung zwei tage später fand das zweite verhör des meisters statt diesmal bat er die kommissare ihn mit dem papst selbst sprechen zu lassen was ihm jedoch nicht gestattet wurde ab februar präsentierten sich eine große zahl templer in paris die den orden verteidigen wollten schließlich erreichte ihre zahl in einer zweiten sitzung von april bis märz befragte die päpstliche kommission die zeugen nach einer neuen liste von anklagepunkten am märz wurde der meister zum dritten mal vor das tribunal geführt am märz erklärten die im garten des bischöflichen palais in paris versammelten verteidiger sich erneut bereit auszusagen die kommission entschied aufgrund ihrer großen zahl dass sie vertreter wählen sollten sie ernannten pierre de bologne früher prokurator des templerordens beim heiligen stuhl rainald de provins komtur von orleans sowie die ritterbrüder guillaume de chambonnet und bertrand de sartiges diese brüder erhielten die freiheit die verteidigung zu organisieren die gefangenen zu besuchen und sie vor der päpstlichen kommission zu vertreten doch am mai verurteilte der erzbischof von sens philippe de marigny vorsitzender der diözesankommission unter deren jurisdiktion auch das bistum paris und damit die dort weilenden templer fielen ordensbrüder die ihre früheren geständnisse widerrufen und erklärt hatten den orden vor der päpstlichen kommission verteidigen zu wollen zum scheiterhaufen daraufhin sah sich die päpstliche kommission gezwungen am mai ihre arbeit einzustellen im dezember des gleichen jahres nahm sie sie wieder auf doch war sie auf verlorenem posten am märz befahl papst clemens allen kirchlichen und weltlichen fürsten eine strengere anwendung der folter um die noch nicht geständigen templer zum geständnis zu bewegen viele von denen die früher den orden entlastet hatten machten nun zumindest teilweise geständnisse der großteil der durch die päpstliche kommission aufgenommenen protokolle datiert aus dieser letzten sitzungsperiode bis mai als die arbeit auf den befehl des französischen königs definitiv eingestellt wurde die protokolle sind sehr kurz enthalten selten mehr als die antwort zu den hauptanklageartikeln anstatt des kompletten fragenkatalogs mit punkten die parallelen die man bei der prüfung der protokolle zwischen den aussagen entdecken kann resultieren daraus dass die gemeinsam nach paris überführten und gefangengehaltenen zeugen sich an früheren aussagen vor ihren jeweiligen diözesankommissionen orientieren so kann man ähnlichkeiten zwischen im limousin verhörten templern entdecken auch wenn jene von ganz verschiedenen persönlichkeiten in den orden aufgenommen wurden wohingegen die prüfung der ordensaufnahmen durch eine bestimmte person die natürlich nicht nur im limousin stattfanden eine große bandbreite aufweisen ein vereinheitlichender faktor war weiterhin die formalisierung der protokolle heute existieren noch von ihnen es sind die aussagen von servienten unter ihnen eine große anzahl komture rittern und priestern der prozess der diözesankommissionen außerhalb der französischen kronlande die erweiterten anklagepunkte der diözesankommissionen die geständnisse der templer aus den ersten beiden verfahren in frankreich zunächst vor den beamten des königs dann vor der inquisition dienten als grundlage für die ausformulierung einer liste von anklagepunkten die für die diözesankommissionen aller länder europas des dritten verfahrens redigiert wurde in dieser liste findet man nun verschiedene varianten für die verleugnung die profanation des kreuzes und vor allem die verschiedensten beschreibungen des angeblichen idols die zeugen greifen bei ihrer aussage offensichtlich auf beschreibungen von idolen zurück die sie aus der hagiographie aus biblischen erzählungen oder aus dem ikonographischen programm von kirchen kannten so taucht ein dreiköpfiger antichrist zum beispiel in der französischen bible moralis e auf beschreibungen und abbildungen von idolen finden sich auch in den mittelalterlichen papstprophetien die dem mönch joachim von fiore zugeschrieben wurden in diesem fall handelt es sich um einen kopf oder büste eines bärtigen mannes die zweite liste der anklagepunkte enthält aber auch viele neue beschuldigungen theologischer art gegen die templer die den bischöflichen kommissaren dabei helfen sollten die angebliche häresie der ordensbrüder einzuordnen man findet hier zum beispiel fragen über den glauben und die sakramente der kirche insbesondere die eucharistie erstmals taucht in dieser zweiten liste von anklagepunkten auch der vorwurf der anbetung einer katze auf ein element das aus der deutschen anti häretischen tradition stammt die artikel wurden in die liste der in paris tagenden päpstlichen kommission des vierten verfahrens übernommen weiter ausgearbeitet wurden lediglich die fragen nach der verbreitung der häresie im orden norditalien der prozess in norditalien wurde wie alle verfahren außerhalb frankreichs durch die bulle faciens misericordiam von initiiert man kennt drei kommissionen die das verfahren sowohl gegen den orden als institution als auch gegen die einzelnen ordensbrüder führten die kommission für die lombardei und die toskana unter dem vorsitz des erzbischofs von pisa des bischofs von florenz und eines kanonikers aus verona die kommission für die romagna unter dem vorsitz des erzbischofs von ravenna die kommission für das patrimonium petri den kirchenstaat und das herzogtum spoleto unter dem vorsitz des erzbischofs von sutri die kommissionen fanden in verbindung mit einem provinzialkonzil statt ein brief der lombardisch toskanischen kommission aus dem jahr erwähnt nur in der gesamten region inhaftierte templer der erste verfahrensgang fand in florenz statt und erbrachte keinerlei resultate nach dem befehl des papstes die folter strenger anzuwenden fand das zweite verfahren statt aber auch jetzt noch machten lediglich sechs der templer teilweise belastende geständnisse die im noch existierenden protokoll niedergelegt sind allein diese sechs geständnisse wurden zum provinzialkonzil gesandt nicht die entlastenden aussagen der prozessverlauf in der romagna begann erst im november mit der befragung zweier templer in cesena durch den erzbischof von ravenna rinaldo da concorezzo januar wurde in ravenna die diözesankommission eröffnet mitte juni vernahm der erzbischof templer aus piacenza unter ihnen ein komtur aus bologna unter ihnen ein provinzmeister einen aus faenza sowie nicht dem orden angehörige zeugen alle templer verneinten die vorgeworfenen verbrechen der erzbischof fragte beim konzil nach ob man die templer foltern solle um geständnisse zu erlangen man sprach sich dagegen aus und für die unschuld der templer mit ausnahme der anwesenden dominikaner die templer meinten die konzilsteilnehmer sollten sich vielmehr von den anklagen mittels einer kanonischen purgatio reinigen einem reinigungseid also die unschuldigen brüder sollten absolviert werden und die schuldigen gemäß dem kanonischen recht bestraft einzigartig für den gesamten prozessverlauf die kommission von ravenna betrachteten jene die aus furcht vor der folter gestanden und anschließend ihre geständnisse zurückgenommen hatten als unschuldig ebenso jene bei denen offensichtlich war dass sie nur aus furcht vor erneuter folter nicht ebenfalls widerriefen die protokolle der kommission von ravenna wurden zum papst gesandt der erzbischof da concorezzo sofort die anwendung der folter befahl die jener aus nachlässigkeit unterlassen habe dennoch führte rinaldo da concorezzo keine neue untersuchung durch aus diesem grund wurde er später von der den templerorden betreffenden kommission auf dem konzil von vienne ausgeschlossen die protokolle der kommission von venedig sind verloren aber es scheint dass auch sie für die templer günstig ausgefallen waren patrimonium petri und spoleto das verfahren der kommission für das patrimonium petri und spoleto begann oktober in rom im kloster s bonifacio ed alessio im dezember sandte man zwei boten in das päpstliche gefängnis von viterbo wo templer einsaßen ein priester und vier servienten die gefangenen lehnten jedwede aussage vor der kommission ab im laufe des april transferierte die kommissionsleitung ihren sitz nach aquila dort verhörte sie nicht ordensangehörige ende april befragte man einen alten templer in penna daraufhin kehrte die kommission nach rom zurück aber im mai wurden erneut boten nach viterbo gesandt nun erklärten sich die vier noch lebenden zeugen zur aussage bereit sie bekannten verschiedene verbrechen vielleicht nach anwendung der folter bekräftigten sie ihre geständnisse einige tage später ende juli wurde noch ein anderer alter templer in palombara vernommen die protokolle der verhöre dieser zeugen existieren noch und geben erwartungsgemäß ein sehr variables bild der dem orden vorgeworfenen häresie einige externe zeugen sagten vor der kommission in segni und velletri aus wie es scheint zugunsten des ordens königreich neapel und grafschaft provence die templer im königreich neapel und in der grafschaft provence territorien von charles ii d anjou wurden im frühjahr nach dem französischen beispiel arretiert im königreich neapel wurden die ersten verhöre durch den erzbischof von brindisi durchgeführt ohne dass man irgendwelche geständnisse erhielt sandte der papst drei inquisitoren um das verfahren fortzuführen möglicherweise war die vorladung nicht richtig veröffentlicht worden denn nur zwei servienten sagten vor der kommission aus man kann jedoch auch annehmen dass die entlastenden aussagen der templer nicht niedergelegt wurden wie dies leider fast überall der fall war die kommission beendete ihre arbeit im grunde ohne ergebnis doch noch papst johannes xxii musste sich mit den in neapel inhaftierten templern beschäftigen die prozessakten der grafschaft provence sind unauffindbar man weiß nur dass siebenundzwanzig templer aus aix und grasse in mayronicis eingekerkert waren und weitere aus arles marseille avignon und nizza in pertuis leon kastilien und portugal im august wurden auch de mitglieder der kommissionen von leon kastilien und portugal ernannt vorsitzende waren die erzbischöfe von toledo santiago de compostela palencia und lissabon man weiß dass der erzbischof von compostela templer und drei externe zeugen in medina del campo befragte ohne belastende geständnisse zu erhalten keine ergebnisse im sinne der anklage gab es auch im verfahren des erzbischofs von lissabon gegen vier externe zeugen in medna del campo er befragte schließlich weitere templer und nicht ordensangehörige die ebenfalls alle anklagepunkte leugneten einzig in einem fragment eines protokolls das die aussagen von nicht templern enthält finden sich einige ungünstige dinge über den orden jedoch keine bestätigung der ihm vorgeworfenen verbrechen im juli berief der erzbischof von toledo ein konzil ein um über die templerfrage zu entscheiden jedoch sind keine dokumente hierzu überliefert oktober sprach sich ein konzil in salamanca für die unschuld des ordens aus und rehabilitierte seine mitglieder navarra in navarra mit der französischen krone seit vereinigt und von einem sohn philipps iv regiert wurden die templer nach dem französischen beispiel inhaftiert auf die bitte des provinzmeisters von aragon katalonien gelang es dem könig von aragon jaime ii zumindest die freilassung der aragonesischen templer zu erwirken die weitere entwicklung der angelegenheit und das schicksal der brüder in navarra sind unbekannt aragon in aragon begannen die templer ihre burgen in den verteidigungszustand zu versetzen nachdem könig jaime ii sich nicht deutlich genug für einen schutz des ordens ausgesprochen hatte am dezember befahl jaime ii seinerseits die arrestierung der ordensbrüder und die sequestration ihrer güter in aragon katalonien und valencia die vorladung der templer vor das inquisitionstribunal blieb ohne ergebnis jaime ordnete daraufhin die belagerung der festungen des ordens an die erste die fiel war pen scola danach burriana coves und einige andere kleine burgen in aragon und katalonien die korrespondenz des königs zeigt dass er von der gelegenheit profitieren wollte um sich der burgen des ordens zu bemächtigen die belagerten in den verbleibenden festungen in erster linie der stellvertreter des provinzmeisters raimon de guardia versuchten zu gunsten der gefangenen zu verhandeln scheiterten jedoch ende oktober ergab sich miravet im mai monz n und chalamera und im august cantavieja damit waren alle festungen in der hand des königs die ordensbrüder wurden in gardeny bellver und anderen ihrer eigenen häuser inhaftiert der prozess begann im frühjahr vor den diözesan kommissaren man weiß von einer kommission der die bischöfe von valencia und saragossa vorstanden von der februar bis märz mehr als templer in lerida vernommen wurden protokolle von servienten rittern und kaplänen sind noch erhalten alle fallen günstig für den orden aus einige tage später gaben die externen zeugen alles kleriker einige amüsante anekdoten zu protokoll die franziskaner sprachen sich für die unschuld der templer aus weitere verfahren fanden in oleto und stella statt alle aussagen entlasteten den orden januar führte der bischof von elne in troilas ein verfahren gegen templer der komturei von mas dieu und ihren dependancen servienten ritter unter ihnen raimon de guardia und kapläne auch er erhielt nur günstige zeugnisse bereits im märz hatten die kommissionen in aragon und katalonien ihre arbeit beendet und die protokolle dem papst geschickt die anordnung desselben die folter anzuwenden traf einige tage später ein die abschlusssentenz des konzils von vienne war letztlich schon gesprochen als ein provinzialkonzil in tarragona erneut über die schuld der templer verhandelte acht brüder wurden vor das tribunal gesandt ein letztes mal unter folter befragt doch sie gestanden nichts die konzilsväter fanden kein einziges der dem orden vorgeworfenen häretischen verbrechen bei ihnen und sprachen sie alle frei wegen der unterdessen vom papst verfügten aufhebung des ordens gewährten die konzilsväter den templern eine pension aus den einkünften der ehemaligen ordensgüter gestattete ihnen papst johannes xxii in andere monastische orden einzutreten england nach der arrestation der templer in frankreich befahl könig philippe iv sie auch könig edward ii von england dieser zeigte sich jedoch zunächst ungläubig und wartete ab er schrieb sogar an die könige von kastilien aragon und portugal über die große reputation die der orden in england genoss und seine geleisteten religiösen dienste er bat den verleumdern des ordens nicht zu glauben und schützte die templer aber schon zu beginn des nächsten jahres wurde er weich und befahl seinerseits die gefangennahme der templer allerdings nicht präzisierte er wie es in frankreich geschehen sei dass man sie unter übelsten bedingungen im kerker oder in ihren eigenen häusern inhaftierte ungefähr templer wurden in england festgenommen unter ihnen der provinzmeister der auvergne himbert blanc und der provinzmeister von england william de la more in london beide blieben bis zu ihrem tode fest bei dem bekenntnis der unschuld die behandlung der gefangenen war nicht so streng wie in frankreich und die folter wurde nicht angewandt der erzbischof von canterbury verkündete allerdings die feierliche exkommunikation gegen alle die templern auf der flucht halfen oder sie beherbergten offenbar also ein häufig vorkommender fall oktober wurden die verfahren der kommissionen gegen die personen einerseits und den orden als institution in london lincoln und york eröffnet aus dem ganzen königreich sandte man die gefangenen dorthin die bestimmenden personen innerhalb dieser tribunale waren außer dem erzbischof von york zwei französische kapläne die in drei diözesen das inquisitionsverfahren in übereinstimmung mit den prälaten ab oktober bis november wurden in london templer befragt die jedoch nichts gestanden im dezember gestattete der könig auf nachfragen der inquisitoren die anwendung der folter doch blieb die anwendung des in england problematisch von januar bis märz wurden weitere templer in london examiniert noch ohne folter und demzufolge auch ohne belastende geständnisse zu erhalten diese ersten verfahren wurden gemäß den anklageartikeln der bulle faciens misericordiam verhört im selben jahr fand ein konzil in york statt dem der erzbischof vorstand um die templerfrage zu entscheiden auf die vorladung meldete sich jedoch keiner der ordensbrüder die konzilsväter betrachteten sie also als verstockte häretiker und reservierte sich die urteilsfällung für eine spätere sitzung im sommer beklagten sich die französischen inquisitoren dass der prozess nicht vorankäme papst clemens beschuldigte die englischen prälaten der nachlässigkeit und forderte aufs neue die strenge anwendung der folter das provinzialkonzil von canterbury das im september des gleichen jahres stattfand entschied die verfahren zu wiederholen diesmal unter anwendung der folter also wurden die in london inhaftierten templer den sheriffs übergeben des weiteren ordnete der könig an alle in seinem reich inhaftierten templer nach london zu bringen in vorbereitung auf ein geplantes provinzialkonzil man weiß von keinen geständnissen während dieser periode des englischen prozesses im frühjahr jedenfalls entschieden die kommissionen ein erneutes vorgehen bei dem neue anklageartikel zum einsatz kommen sollten die zum beispiel die leugnung der ewigen seligkeit enthielten und die leugnung der transsubstantiation aber die aussagen von befragen externen zeugen erbrachte nichts als einen allgemeinen verdacht und dieser war ja schon im verlauf des prozesses geschürt worden und konnte daher nicht als beweis gewertet werden im april nahm die kommission in london die aussagen von einer großen anzahl laien und mitgliedern der bettelorden auf während dieser sitzung wurden die protokolle redigiert die uns heute einige farbige templer legenden zeigen denen allerdings der bezug zur wirklichkeit fehlt doch die kommissare gaben den angeklagten die möglichkeit der verteidigung der provinzmeister von england und seine gefährten die in london inhaftiert waren bekannten ihren katholischen glauben wurde ein zweites konzil in york einberufen während dessen die befragten templer den allgemeinen häresieverdacht gegen ihren orden bestätigten natürlich bestand ein solcher nach jahren diverser verfahren in ganz europa die angeklagten erhielten die absolution und man verteilte sie auf verschiedene klöster damit sie dort buße täten im juni und im juli fand ein weiteres konzil in london statt auf dem man endlich drei belastende geständnisse erzielte die bekennenden waren zwei ehemalige templer und der schatzmeister des temple von london dies sind vermutlich die einzigen geständnisse des gesamten prozesses in england auf ihrer grundlage wurde der orden in england verurteilt der großteil der templer wurde nach dem letzten urteilsspruch in klöster gesandt nur die beiden provinzmeister von england und der auvergne blieben in haft guillaume de la more starb himbert blanc nach irland die templer in irland wurden ebenfalls im januar auf befehl könig edwards inhaftiert und ihre güter konfisziert einige leute wie der schatzmeister der krone für irland nutzten die gelegenheit sich einiger güter zu bemächtigen wie es scheint wurden alle ordensbrüder in dublin festgehalten wo die diözesankommission unter dem vorsitz des erzbischofs und der vom papst entsandten inquisitoren tagte die verhöre begannen im januar in der kathedrale sankt patrick aussagen der dubliner templer sind die einzigen protokolle die erhalten sind möglicherweise bestand diese gruppe nur aus komturen denn man kennt in irland rund ordenshäuser die unmöglich mit allein mann besetzt gewesen sein können diese templer unter ihnen der provinzmeister henry tanet und sein kaplan stritten die anklagepunkte ab anschließend befragte die kommission noch externe zeugen von denen angehörige anderer orden waren sie erzählten zum großteil allgemeine gerüchte und legenden vom hörensagen zwei zeugen erklärten sie hätten templer gesehen die die hostie bei der elevation nicht angesehen hätten das ist alles die kommission von dublin beendete ihre arbeit im juni die versorgung der gefangenen gestaltete sich äußerst schwierig trotz des königlichen befehls dass sie aus einkünften ihrer güter zu unterhalten seien doch jene befanden sich unterdessen oft längst in zweifelhaften dritten und vierten händen bittet der irische provinzmeister um seine freilassung gegen kaution um den unterhalt seiner brüder sicherzustellen der könig gab der bitte nicht statt sondern betraute den justiziar von irland mit der führung der ehemaligen templergüter und der versorgung der inhaftierten nach der aufhebung des ordens durch die bulle vox in excelso wurden die in dublin inhaftierten templer entlassen der provinzmeister gegen kaution schottland in schottland gelang es lediglich zwei templer festzunehmen und diese beiden gestanden nichts auch externe zeugen machten keinerlei belastende aussagen zahlreiche spätere legenden aus dem kreis der folklore und der freimaurer berichten dass die ordensbrüder in schottland offiziellen schutz genossen hätten doch der beweis fehlt bis jetzt deutschland der deutsche könig albrecht i leistete den forderungen keine folge die der französische könig an ihn richtete er ließ die templer nicht verhaften die deutschen prälaten waren dem orden auch nicht feindlich gesinnt mit ausnahme des erzbischofs von magdeburg burchard iii dennoch begann auch hier das angeordnete verfahren papst clemens befahl peter von aspelt dem erzbischof von mainz und seinen suffraganen gegen die einzelnen personen des ordens vorzugehen doch sollten sie sich jedweden urteils über den orden als institution und auch über den provinzmeister von deutschland enthalten den vorsitz über die einzelnen diözesankommissionen sollten die erzbischöfe von mainz köln trier magdeburg prag riga und die bischöfe von basel konstanz breslau und uppsala innehaben trotz des ausdrücklichen befehls des papstes ließ der erzbischof von magdeburg den provinzmeister friedrich von alvensleben inhaftieren ebenso wie einige andere brüder der provinz die entkommenen templer suchten mit einigen freunden zuflucht in der burg von beyernaumburg gelegen in der diözese halberstadt daraufhin suchte burkhard den platz mit gewalt zu erobern eine handlung für die ihn albrecht i von anhalt der bischof von halberstadt exkommunizierte schließlich war der erzbischof von magdeburg gezwungen einen vertrag mit den templern zu schließen in dem er ihnen sicherheit versprach die prozessakten des deutschen verfahrens sind verloren man weiß nichtsdestoweniger dass der orden hier viele freunde besaß denn im september spricht der erzbischof von mainz peter von aspelt in einem brief von einem begonnenen inquisitionsverfahren gegen die begünstiger der templer mai fand ein provinzialkonzil in mainz statt während dessen etwa bewaffnete ordensbrüder mit ihrem komtur sich überraschend einfanden und gegen die ungerechten verfahren in frankreich protestierten der erzbischof versprach in dieser sache sich an den papst zu wenden und entließ sie ohne jeden versuch sie festzusetzen vermutlich wurden im laufe dieses konzils noch weitere zeugen unter ihnen templer vernommen die zugunsten des ordens aussagten das konzil von mainz entschied also die unschuld dieser personen und gegen den befehl des papstes auch die unschuld des gesamten ordens aus diesem grunde annullierte clemens v die mainzer sentenz über das weitere schicksal der deutschen templer ist nichts bekannt nach dem konzil von vienne wurden sie gezwungen ihre güter zu verlassen zypern im märz erhielt der bischof von limassol und administrator der kirche von nicosia auf zypern den päpstlichen befehl den prozess gegen die templer zu eröffnen als er bemerkte dass die brüder entschlossen waren sich zu verteidigen und sei es mit waffengewalt wandte sich der bischof an amaury von tyrus regent der insel einen monat später war es amaury gelungen die templer zu entwaffnen weniger mit gewalt als mit geschick und versprechungen vermutlich denn der orden war sein alter verbündeter im kampf um die krone amaury konfiszierte die güter und ließ die kirchen der templer schließen doch der abgesetzte könig henri ii protestierte und erlangte so die wiedereröffnung der kirchen und die möglichkeit für die brüder messe zu feiern die proteste amaurys an den papst blieben ohne wirkung clemens v sandte seinen legat um gegen die zypriotischen templer das verfahren einzuleiten dennoch begann dieses erst im mai und zwar unter dem vorsitz der bischöfe von famagusta und limassol bis zum mai nahm man die aussagen von externen zeugen auf unter ihnen verwandte des abgesetzten königs henri ii den templern feindlich gesinnt wie man annahm ab dem mai bis zum mai wurden ordensbrüder befragt ritterbrüder unter ihnen der marschall des ordens ayme d oiselier und der provinzmeister von apulien odo de villarote servienten und kapläne aus allen provinzen des ordens vom bis zum juni wurden weitere externe zeugen aus allen sozialen schichten vernommen sämtliche templer verneinten die anklagepunkte und verteidigten den orden und auch die externen zeugen einschließlich der verwandten henri ii machten keine belastenden aussagen sie erinnerten an die große verehrung der templer für das heilige kreuz ihre heroische verteidigung des heiligen landes und unterstrichen dass die gerüchte ihren anfang erst nach der veröffentlichung der anklagepunkte begannen einer der zeugen berichtete sogar ein hostienwunder um den katholischen glauben der ordensbrüder zu bekräftigen die bulle vox in excelso von und der letzte akt in paris die diözesankommissionen führten ihre arbeit gegen die personen des ordens auch noch nach dessen offizieller aufhebung fort die auf dem generalkonzil von vienne mit der bulle vox in excelso am märz ausgesprochen wurde die bulle ad providendam vom mai desselben jahres sprach beinahe alle güter des templerordens den johannitern zu das verfahren gegen den meister und die anderen obersten in frankreich inhaftierten würdenträger wurde im dezember einer kardinalskommission übertragen sie fällte ihr urteil das auf lebenslangen kerker lautete am märz jacques de molay und der provinzmeister der normandie godefrois de charny widerriefen daraufhin öffentlich all ihre früheren geständnisse und erklärten die unschuld des ordens könig philippe iv ließ sie noch am selben abend auf einer seine insel verbrennen die anderen beiden ordensoberen der vormalige großvisitator hugues de pairaud und der ordensmeister von aquitanien godefroi de gonneville schwiegen dagegen und wurden zu lebenslanger haft verurteilt pairaud saß noch bis mindestens in kerkerhaft und wurde in diesem jahr nochmals nach dem verschwundenen templerschatz befragt ein offizieller schuldspruch im sinne des kanonischen rechts war übrigens nie erfolgt die aufhebung erfolgte lediglich mit der begründung der allgemeinen unruhe und der infamie die durch den prozess entstanden sei der templerprozess in zeitgenössischen chroniken quellen aus dem deutschsprachigen raum die salzburger annalen entstanden um halten die anklagen des französischen königs für wahr quelle mgh ss rer ger ix s der cistercienserabt johann von viktring kärnten gest berichtet dass die johanniter die annahme der templergüter verweigert hätten weil die templer zu unrecht vernichtet worden seien höchstens einige personen hätten gefehlt der orden aber sei herrlich und hell leuchtend am firmament der kirche gewesen für diese behauptung über die johanniter gibt es keine anhaltspunkte quelle mgh ss rer ger xxxvi die königssaaler chronik verfasst vom cistercienserabt peter von zittau um erzählt wie der papst den mächtigsten und in der ganzen christenheit berühmten orden zerstört habe indem er ihm viele irrtümer zuschrieb nach der ansicht vieler sei aber keine häresie sondern die begierde schlechter menschen nach den besitztümern des ordens ursache seiner vernichtung gewesen die magdeburger schöppenchronik entstanden um nennt ketzerei und hochmut als grund für den sturz der templer der bayerische kontinuator der aus dem jh stammenden sächsischen weltchronik fällt ein hartes urteil über papst clemens v aufgrund des templerprozesses nur aus anhänglichkeit an den französischen könig und aus habgier habe clemens einen ehrenhaften orden zerstört der thüringische kontinuator der chronik lässt papst clemens sogar weinend und klagend über seine sünde den templerorden zerstört zu haben sterben quelle mgh deutsche chroniken ii s u s quellen aus dem italienischen raum dante beklagt in seiner divina commedia purgatorio xx die vernichtung des templerordens ohne wirkliche rechtliche grundlage und vergleicht papst clemens mit dem aus der passionsgeschichte bekannten römischen statthalter pontius pilatus infolgedessen präsentiert er clemens auch als der verdammnis anheimgefallen übrigens noch vor dessen tatsächlich erfolgten tod der florentiner chronist giovanni villani gest berichtet sehr detailliert über prozess und vernichtung des ordens und erklärt der französische könig habe aus habgier und verleitet von seinen beamten gehandelt und der papst sei durch den könig mit einem prozess gegen seinen amtsvorgänger bonifatius viii erpresst worden gegen die templer einzuschreiten die asche der in paris letztlich verbrannten templer sei von den leuten als reliquien der martyrer gesammelt worden und könig philipp sowie seine söhne hätten für ihre sünde viele widrigkeiten als strafe gottes erleiden müssen nuova chronica liber c xcii wird fortgesetzt der templerprozess ursachen und verantwortlichkeiten der kampf zwischen könig und papst staat und kirche vorboten die frage warum könig philipp iv von frankreich mittels seiner infamierungskampagne zum großen schlag gegen den templerorden ausholte muss vor dem hintergrund seiner gesamtpolitischen situation und vor allem seiner staatsbildenden maßnahmen betrachtet werden beinahe seit beginn seiner regierungszeit steuerte philipp iv einen autokratisch absolutistischen kurs der auf die unabhängigkeit des staates von der kirche zielte bzw auf eine unterordnung letzterer unter den staat und damit den könig schloss philipp die geistlichkeit aus der gerichtsadministration aus reorganisierte er das parlament die durchgesetzte besteuerung des klerus sorgte für aufruhr und für die zornige publizierung der bulle clericis laicos durch papst bonifatius viii in der er jeden christen ohne kirchenamt der kirchlichen besitz beansprucht exkommuniziert das generalkapitel der zisterzienser protestierte feierlich auf einer sitzung in paris gegen die besteuerung der streit eskalierte sehr rasch unter anderem fällt ihm der bischof des neu gegründeten bistums pamiers bernard de saisset der sich offen gegen die politik des königs ausspricht zum opfer er wird eingekerkert und gefoltert in einer dem papst vorgelegten klageschrift wirft man saisset neben majestätsbeleidigung auch blasphemie unzucht und häretisches gedankengut vor papst bonifatius viii spricht sich nach begutachtung der angelegenheit für die unschuld des inhaftierten bischofs aus widerruft das privileg nach dem französische könige nicht exkommuniziert werden dürften und beruft ein konzil nach rom ein dem generalabt der cistercienser johann iii der dem päpstlichen aufruf für ein konzil folgend nach rom reisen wollte antwortet der könig mit dem befehl sämtliche güter ungehorsamer prälaten einzuziehen eine anordnung die hauptsächlich die cistercienser betraf auch die scharf formulierte bulle bonifatius viii ausculta fili mit der er noch einmal die fronten zwischen geistlicher und weltlicher gewalt klären will bleibt ungehört saisset bleibt in haft das ausreiseverbot für französische kleriker zum einberufenen konzil nach rom und das ausfuhrverbot von edelmetallen aus frankreich wird nicht aufgehoben bekräftigte der papst die exkommunikation philipps iv falls die prälaten nicht umgehend ausreisen dürften die königlichen rechtsberater guillaume de plaisians und guillaume de nogaret antworten ihrerseits mit der einberufung der sogenannten generalstände einer aus klerus adel und vertretern der städte bestehenden nationalversammlung unter anderem der zisterzienser generalabt johann iii protestiert gegen dieses vorgehen worauf hin er als gefangener ins ch telet abtransportiert wird am november veröffentlicht papst bonifatius viii die bulle unam sanctam der in der kirchengeschichte am deutlichsten formulierte anspruch auf suprematie der geistlichen über die weltliche gewalt von philipp verlangte der papst einen sofortigen bußgang nach rom um die drohende exkommunikation abzuwenden die reaktion philipps iv ist legendär er lässt nicht nur eine anklageschrift gegen den papst verfassen und veröffentlichen in der jener der usurpation des amtes der teufelsbuhlschaft unzucht und häresie angeklagt wird sondern er lässt bonifatius viii schließlich sogar am september in anagni wohin sich der papst geglaubt hatte in sicherheit bringen zu können überfallen und festsetzen kurz nach seiner befreiung durch einen volksaufruhr stirbt der papst johann iii von c teaux kommt wieder auf freien fuß dankt aber ab um seinen orden vor verfolgungen zu bewahren interessanterweise tat sich der templerorden nicht als sonderlicher gegner der königlichen bestrebungen in dieser zeit hervor wohl auch weil er noch von unternehmungen im orient absorbiert war finanzielle probleme der französischen krone der staatsumbau wie philipp iv ihn praktizierte war sehr kostenintensiv hinzu kamen mehrere kriege gegen aragon gegen england und vor allem gegen flandern für die schlichtweg die finanziellen mittel fehlten ließ der könig die ansässigen lombardischen geldverleiher verhaften und erst gegen erhebliche lösegelder wieder frei vertrieb philipp iv die juden aus frankreich und konfiszierte ihre güter nachdem er sie bereits einer sondersteuer unterworfen bzw wichtige vertreter eingekerkert und lösegeld erpresst hatte der versuch auch die kirche zu besteuern wurde bereits oben erwähnt neben diesen griff der könig auch noch zu anderen maßnahmen um geld zu sparen bzw zu beschaffen einführung neuer steuern verminderung des gold und silbergehalts der münzen beides führte zu mehreren aufruhren unter dem volk und vor allem den händlern der temple von paris als finanzzentrum frankreichs vor seinem schlag gegen den templerorden verfügte die französische krone über zwei staatskassen eine im louvre und eine im haupthaus der templer dem temple von paris deponiert wo sich auch der rechnungshof befand das ordenshaus war damit nicht nur ein als sicher betrachteter verwahrort für den staatsschatz sondern ein regelrechtes finanzielles zentrum von dem aus im namen der krone transaktionen stattfanden das als bank genutzt wurde in das einkünfte des königreichs geschickt wurden und dessen schatzmeister ein templer dreimal jährlich einen rechenschaftsbericht an den könig ablieferte all dies auf grund von privilegien die frühere französische könige dem orden gewährt hatten die in paris in den händen der templer befindlichen ressourcen templerschatz wenn auch nicht ihnen voll und ganz gehörend waren damit umfangreich hinzu kamen die immobilien und die einkünfte hieraus dies konnte philipp iv nicht entgangen sein er scheint sich von der abhängigkeit gegenüber dem orden befreien gewollt zu haben in dem er einen bereits früher angewandten mechanismus der häresieanklage gegen die templer in bewegung setzte glaubte er offenbar die lösung für mehrere probleme anzugehen zum einen die finanzielle notlage zum anderen die von staatlicher gewalt ausgenommene dem papst unterstellte autarkie diverser orden und letztlich die unabhängigkeit der römisch katholischen kirche selbst ob philipp iv zu irgendeinem zeitpunkt des prozesses tatsächlich glaubte der orden sei von häretischem gedankengut durchsetzt sei dahingestellt darf aber stark bezweifelt werden denn er bemühte sich nach kräften jedwede möglichkeit einer verteidigung von vornherein auszuschalten bzw sie im nachhinein zu diskreditieren und er erpresste papst clemens v mehrmals um genehme entscheidungen hinsichtlich der verurteilung der templer zu erhalten ordensinterne gründe warum die templer hierfür gibt es mehrere gründe von denen einige oben bereits angeführt wurden der orden war im gegensatz zu etwa den ebenfalls kirchenpolitisch bedeutsamen und direkt dem papst unterstehenden cisterciensern oder den bettelorden eine nicht zu unterschätzende a finanzmacht und b militärische macht die könig philipp iv bei seinen staatspolitischen absichten im wege stand oder von der er zumindest meinte sie könne ihm unter gewissen umständen im wege stehen der orden hatte zudem das pech seiner eigentlichen daseinsberechtigung der verteidigung der christen und der heiligen stätten in palästina nicht mehr nachkommen zu können der letzte rückeroberungsversuch mit beteiligung des ordensmeisters jacques de molay war kläglich gescheitert neue kreuzzüge blieben in der planungsphase und während es den johannitern gelang sich auf der insel rhodos eine neue operationsbasis mit blickpunkt orient zu erobern verlegten die templer unglücklicherweise den ordenssitz nach paris ein rückgang der attraktivität des ordens als adressat für schenkungen und konversionen ist nur insofern festzustellen als alle traditionellen orden in dieser zeit einbußen erlitten vor den modernen ordensformen der bettelorden eine zunehmende verarmung des adels hatte hier ebenfalls einfluss dennoch gibt es eintritte in den templerorden bis zum jahr ebenso schenkungen und privilegien von kirchlicher und weltlicher seite auffällig große einbußen scheint der ruf also vor der inszenierten infamierung durch könig philipp nicht erlitten zu haben fest steht dass sowohl die einfachen brüder als auch die ordensführung von dem gegen sie in die wege geleiteten prozess mit seiner neuen noch nicht einmal approbierten form völlig überfordert waren bereits mit der ersten anklageschrift und dem ersten widerrechtlich vor den beamten des königs geführten verfahren war dem prozess eine zielrichtung gegeben worden aus dem der einzelne schwerlich entkommen konnte hatte könig philipp letztlich erfolg was die finanzielle seite betraf so kann nur von einem teilerfolg die rede sein denn die immobilien des templerordens überschrieb der papst zum hauptteil den johannitern bulle ad providendam ersatzweise livres für die güter und livres als unkostenentschädigung für die haft und verfahren wurden dem könig zugeschrieben eine eher magere ausbeute von der seite der propaganda und der diffamierung des ordens erreichte der könig ebenfalls nicht in gänze woran ihm gelegen war zahlreiche zeitgenossen und autoren späterer jahrhunderte sahen sehr wohl genau dass philipp hiermit keinen notwendigen kreuzzug gegen eine häresie geführt hatte sondern der staatsraison und privater gier opferte davon legen nicht nur zahlreiche chronisten auch in frankreich vor allem aber außerhalb zeugnis ab sondern beispielsweise auch dante in seiner divina commedia allerdings gab es immer einen kleinen überlieferungsstrang der pro königlich argumentierte und der im laufe der jahrhunderte die den templern zugeschriebenen verbrechen immer phantastischer ausmalte einer ihrer glanzpunkte die chronique de saint denis aus paris ein gewisser verdachtsmoment ein hauch des und wenn doch tradierten sich in diversen strömungen die sich zum beispiel im jahrhundert in der freimaurer mythologie verbreiterten oder im jahrhundert in zum teil ausgesprochen obskuren und radikalen sekten templer ist in der modernen kultur vielfach ein synonym für geheimnis das von romanautoren fernsehregisseuren und anderen benutzt wird dabei hat sich die natur des geheimnisses von jenen mittelalterlichen anklagepunkten heute mehr in die pantheistisch esoterische richtung verschoben insofern kann man sagen hatte könig philipp erfolg der orden ging nicht als normaler christlicher orden in die geschichte ein wie etwa die johanniter die franziskaner die benediktiner etc sondern als eine gemeinschaft die etwas was auch immer das sei zu verbergen hatte und die in irgendeiner weise außerhalb der etablierten katholischen lehre stand beträchtlich und von philipp iv sicherlich nicht beabsichtigt war der schaden auf kirchenpolitischer und spiritueller ebene der christenheit den der prozess anrichtete nicht von ungefähr leitet der templerprozess in die epoche des avignonesischen papsttums und schließlich des großen schismas und der reformation über bis dahin als grundlage der weltordnung aufgefasste werte waren unwiderruflich zerstört worden wirklich erwiesen ist allerdings nur die haltung des papstes gegenüber den vorwürfen die den templern zur last gelegt wurden quellen zufolge war er von der unschuld der templer überzeugt allerdings konnte sich der papst nicht gegen könig philipp durchsetzen u a auch weil der papstsitz zu jener zeit in frankreich gelegen war

mannheim nach basel sowie den bau des mannheimer hafens trat nebenius als geheimer sekretär beim finanzdepartement in den badischen staatsdienst und nutzte einen längeren urlaub zu einem aufenthalt in paris und besan on um dort den geschäftsgang der französischen behörden zu studieren nebenius lernte sozusagen in der praxis beim administrator der departments doubs und bas rhin dem früheren abgeordneten der französischen nationalversammlung jean antoine joseph debry debry der zugleich der provinzialgroßmeister für burgund des französisch schweizerischen freimaurerordens chevaliers bienfaisants de la cite sainte und meister vom stuhl der freimaurerloge sinc rit et la parfaite union in besan on war führte nebenius während dieser zeit in die freimaurerei zum kreisrat in durlach ernannt wurde er in das finanzministerium berufen wo er mit dem späteren finanzminister christian friedrich böckh schwierige und komplizierte aufgaben auf dem gebiete der organisation und der gesetzgebung löste es gehörten dazu die umfassende revision des steuerkatasters die einleitungen zum vollzug der gesetzgebung über die indirekten steuern und die umgestaltung des gesamten staatsrechnungswesens dies waren gewaltige aufgaben wenn man bedenkt dass einheitliche richtlinien für eine vielzahl von territorien einzuführen waren die bisher nicht zu baden gehörten dies geschah in einer zeit in welcher die durch die napoleonischen kriege und ihre folgen der staatskasse wie den bewohnern des landes auferlegten lasten sich bis zum unerträglichen steigerten auch der notstand welcher nach endlicher herstellung des friedens in den teuerungsjahren jahr ohne sommer und herrschte nahm die arbeitskraft von nebenius sehr in anspruch sowohl durch die vermehrten geschäfte im finanzministerium als durch die anstrengende tätigkeit in einer zur linderung des notstands besonders niedergesetzten immediatcommission nach langen seit andauernden verhandlungen unter der führung von ernst philipp von sensburg wurde nebenius von großherzog karl beauftragt einen neuen entwurf einer verfassungsurkunde auszuarbeiten und auf grund dieses entwurfes erfolgte am august die verkündung der verfassung des großherzogtums baden der freiheitlichsten verfassung in deutschland zu dieser zeit die gründliche kenntnis des wirtschaftslebens nicht nur des eigenen landes und der nachbarstaaten sondern auch nach damaligen begriffen ferner länder wie großbritannien belegten seine diesbezüglichen veröffentlichungen erschien sein klassisches werk über den öffentlichen credit das heinrich von treitschke auf eine stufe mit dem werke david ricardos stellt und als eine unschätzbare schule streng methodischen denkens rühmt wilhelm roscher als die beste monographie in der volkswirthschaftlichen literatur deutschlands bezeichnete als besonders herausragend gelten zudem nebenius bemerkungen über den zustand großbritanniens in staatswirthschaftlicher hinsicht eine schrift welche auch deutschlands handelsverhältnisse berührte und verkehrsfreiheit im innern grenzzölle nach außen unter einführung eines gemeinsamen mauthsystemes an den grenzen verlangte und die erst im buchhandel veröffentlichte denkschrift über das deutsche zollwesen nebenius erschien ein deutscher zollverein als das wirksamste mittel zur rettung aus dem herrschenden notstand unter dem handel und industrie deutschlands zu erliegen drohten nebenius schwebte ein kleindeutscher zollverein unter ausschluss österreich ungarns vor wobei dieses kaiserreich dem zollverein per handelsvertrag assoziiert werden sollte indem nebenius in seiner denkschrift die notwendigkeit der zollgemeinschaft betonte wies er auch die möglichkeit und die bedingungen der ausführung als erster deutscher staatsmann nach wenn auch später die gestaltung des späteren großen deutschen zollvereins von den gedanken denen nebenius in jener denkschrift ausdruck gab mannigfach abwich so durfte ihr urheber sich doch nach abschluss des preußisch hessischen zollbundes der anerkennung seiner arbeit durch keinen geringeren als friedrich eichhorn erfreuen welcher am november schrieb zur großen genugthuung wird es dem verfasser gereichen wenn er aus den verträgen der jetzt zu einem gemeinsamen zoll und handelssystem verbundenen staaten ersehen wird wie vollständig nunmehr die ideen ins leben getreten sind welche von ihm schon im j über die bedingungen eines deutschen zollvereins gehegt und bekannt gemacht worden sind nicht minderen anteil hatte nebenius an dem badischen volksschulgesetz von als im jahr ein konzessionsgesuch für einen schienenweg durch die rheinebene in geradester und kürzester linie von mannheim nach basel bei der regierung eingereicht wurde bestanden in deutschland nur ein paar kurze bahnstrecken die aus privatmitteln erbaut waren dem zur prüfung des vorschlags niedergesetzten regierungskomitee schlug nebenius vor die bahn auf staatskosten zu bauen sein später durch den druck vervielfältigtes gutachten das einen weiten blick mit gründlichkeit und allseitiger prüfung der einschlägigen punkte verbindet veranlasste den landtag dem projekt zuzustimmen seiner initiative und energie ist auch der für die damaligen verhältnisse sehr bedeutende hafenbau in mannheim zu verdanken nebenius hat mit diesen projekten den wirtschaftlichen und politischen zusammenhalt und weiterentwicklung des neuen landes baden entscheidend gefördert wurde friedrich nebenius das kommenturkreuz des zähringer löwen ordens verliehen und leitete er als staatsminister heute würde man sagen ministerpräsident die badischen regierungsgeschäfte im oktober musste er auf grund von meinungsverschiedenheiten mit seinem konservativen gegenspieler außenminister friedrich landolin karl von blittersdorf zurücktreten im rahmen der revolution von wurde nebenius aus dem staatsdienst entlassen er war mitglied der freimaurerloge carl zur eintracht in mannheim und leopold zur treue in karlsruhe nebenius hatte maßgeblichen anteil daran dass freimaurerlogen im großherzogtum baden wieder öffentlich zugelassen wurden nebenius war ein enger politischer und freimaurerischer weggefährte von karl heinrich rau mit dem er sich auch familiär verband seine tochter albertine vermählte sich mit raus sohn und freimaurerbruder ludwig er war ferner ein schwager des liberalen badischen innenministers ludwig georg von winter mit dem er ebenfalls politisch sehr eng zusammenarbeitete zu seinen enkeln gehörte der reichsgerichtsrat ernst heydweiller über ihn war nebenius mit dem

und auerstedt seine tore geschlossen hatte erst rahel führte seit den er jahren wieder einen salon trafen sie in berlin wieder für längere zeit aufeinander doch die frühere vertrautheit stellte sich nicht mehr ein paulines eigensinn und rahels emotionalität wollten sich im alter nicht mehr recht vertragen affäre mit prinz louis ferdinand wann und wo pauline den prinzen louis ferdinand von preußen kennenlernte steht nicht fest wahrscheinlich ist aber dass sie einander das erste mal im jahre im salon der rahel zu deren habitu s auch der prinz gehörte begegneten und sich bald voneinander angezogen fühlten louis ferdinand der liebling der genossen der abgott schöner frau n war damals sicher der beliebteste hohenzollernprinz allerdings hatte louis der seit jeher ein aufregendes liebesleben führte mit henriette fromm bereits eine lebensgefährtin mit deren existenz pauline sich wohl oder übel abfinden musste auch pauline hatte wie gewohnt ihre verehrer darunter die diplomaten karl gustav brinckmann und friedrich gentz so war ihre beziehung zu dem prinzen von anfang an von spannungen geprägt louis loulou suchte in pauline wohl vor allem das schnelle erotische vergnügen pauline pölle erhoffte sich ihrerseits emotionale nähe und auch die gesellschaftliche legitimation ihres verhältnisses das nicht nur frivol war sondern in hohem maße als unstandesgemäß galt auch das intellektuelle gefälle zwischen beiden wird keine unerhebliche rolle gespielt haben gegen ende des jahres erreichte die stimmung zwischen ihnen einen tiefpunkt pauline schrieb sogar einen abschiedsbrief im folgenden jahr renkte sich die beziehung allerdings wieder ein was nicht zuletzt der vermittlung rahels zu danken gewesen sein wird nun war es prinz louis der sogar eine scheidung paulines von ihrem wenig geliebten ehemann verlangte während andererseits henriette immer eifersüchtiger wurde und sogar damit drohte ihre kinder aus der beziehung mit louis seiner schwester der prinzessin luise radziwill offiziell vorzustellen pauline und louis übten sich vorläufig in zurückhaltung doch hatte sich ihre gegenseitige zuneigung mittlerweile so vertieft dass sich pauline ernsthaft ein kind von ihrem liebhaber wünschte dieser wunsch ging allerdings ebenso wenig in erfüllung wie sich die gewohnt angespannte finanzielle lage der beiden gebessert hätte prinz louis den sein vater prinz ferdinand von preußen materiell am gängelband hielt war seit langem hoch verschuldet so hoch dass er sich gelegentlich sogar von pauline geld borgen musste als im august der vierte koalitionskrieg mit frankreich ausbrach ging prinz louis der hoffnungsträger der veralteten preußischen armee als kommandeur der vorhut an die front wo er bereits am oktober bei saalfeld im ersten waffengang des krieges mit knapp jahren fiel nach dem zeugnis rahels wurde pauline von dem tod des prinzen schwer getroffen in der zeit unmittelbar danach soll sie an selbstmord gedacht haben schließlich fasste sie sich wieder musste aber einsehen dass ihr platz in der berliner gesellschaft nun kaum mehr zu halten war zumal die liberalität und aufgeschlossenheit der rahel zeit mit der niederlage von schnell ihr ende fand ein versuch beim bruder ihres gefallenen freundes prinz august von preußen um wirtschaftliche unterstützung nachzusuchen verlief ergebnislos schließlich verließ sie berlin und suchte ihr glück in den armen neuer liebhaber durch eine leibrente des grafen schuwalow mit dem sie anfang des jahrhunderts eine affäre gehabt hatte wurde sie später einigermaßen sichergestellt fortleben die meisten handschriftlichen briefe von und an pauline wiesel sowie weitere lebenszeugnisse in form anekdotischer aufzeichnungen befinden sich in der sammlung varnhagen deren

de,das rockharz open air ist ein metalfestival und findet seit jährlich am harz statt angefangen hat es mit rund besuchern und gigs auf lkw anhängern seitdem entwickelte es sich zu einer festen größe im jährlichen metalfestival plan im jahr wurden rund besucher gezählt als festivalgelände dient der flugplatz ballenstedt ein besonderes merkmal des rockharz open air sind die beiden gleichwertigen bühnen als rock stage und dark stage bezeichnet was sich nur auf wenigen anderen festival dieser art in deutschland finden lässt außerdem gibt es keine zeitüberschneidungen zwischen den bandauftritten sodass es den besuchern tatsächlich möglich ist jeden bandauftritt zu sehen geschichte anfänge in den ern gründer war ursprünglich der verein rock und kultur am harz e v das rockharz lief zunächst unter dem namen rock gegen rechts und zog fast besucher in die stadthalle osterode im jahr darauf wurde das festival auf das freizeitgelände in osterode lasfelde verlegt und somit zu einer echten open air veranstaltung mit immerhin besuchern gleichzeitig erfolgte die umbenennung in rockharz openair regionale bands traten auf einem lkw anhänger auf und legten so den grundstein für das rockharz open air spätestens wurde für das festival eine richtige open air bühne errichtet es spielten bands wie guano apes the atmosfear hungerstrike wasteland catty caress und tallian gray und die ersten zelte wurden aufgeschlagen im nächsten jahr spielten bands darunter speak n fish mcdoors silent hectic wild thing und raw vor rund besuchern ein neuer zuschauerrekord erstmals wurde auch eintritt verlangt um die kosten zu decken headliner war die deutsche alternative rock band donots leider erfüllten die besucherzahlen nicht die erwartungen im jahr kooperierte das rockharz deshalb mit dem europäischen jugendcamp am freitag gab es eine techno disco unter freiem himmel und es traten verschiedene breakdance gruppen auf der samstag des camps gehörte hingegen ganz dem rockharz mit bands wie eaten by sheiks pussy box und perfect das konzept an den beiden tagen jeweils unterschiedliches publikum anzuziehen wurde auch im folgejahr angewandt somit wartete das rockharz auch mit einer mischung aus verschiedenen stilen auf diesmal am freitag mit metal bands wie flowing tears die apokalyptischen reiter oder skyclad und am samstag mit metal und rock coverbands die größen wie kiss iron maiden u und die beatles kopierten wachstum bis ende der er ab wurde für die insgesamt auftretenden bands eine zweite bühne benötigt um bands wie schandmaul mila mar end of green und j b o unterzubringen damit verschob sich das konzept mehr und mehr in richtung metal neue deutsche härte und dark rock trotzdem wurde auch noch in einen metal day am freitag unter anderem mit mehreren lokalen metal bands und einen samstag mit unterschiedlicher musikalischer ausrichtung und bands wie schandmaul mila mar und merlons lichter unterschieden es wurde jedoch weiterhin darauf geachtet regionale bands zu unterstützen und zu fördern indem diese zusammen mit internationalen bands auftraten und dadurch ein größeres publikum angezogen wurde so wurden zum beispiel mit the atmosfear fear of the dawn meatgrinder gondwania oder worst oft metal bands direkt aus osterode gebucht ebenso aus dem weiteren südniedersächsischen umkreis wie elements of change aus clausthal zellerfeld don t aus seesen moskote aus goslar skylax aus einbeck oder fading starlight aus holzminden auch die lokalmatadoren raw spielten mehrfach auf dem rockharz ebenso die osteroder dark at dawn um frontmann thorsten buddy kohlrausch der selbst seit an der organisation des rockharz beteiligt ist durch national erfolgreiche bands wie subway to sally die apokalyptischen reiter majesty circle ii circle disbelief und edge of thorns wurde publikum aus ganz deutschland angezogen in den folgejahren wuchs das rockharz immer weiter und bot den fans ein line up von bands wie grave digger doro rage holy moses und onkel tom wurde die zweite bühne bis dahin eine zeltbühne ebenfalls in eine open air bühne umgewandelt in diesem jahr war das rockharz auch von regen sturm und einem kälteeinbruch mit temperaturen bis zu c betroffen der konzertbetrieb musste sogar kurzzeitig unterbrochen werden einen gewissen kultstatus errang der alleinunterhalter mambo kurt der zwischen und jährlich auf dem festival auftrat und dabei oft als eine art opener bekannte metal songs auf seiner heimorgel interpretierte aufgrund der enorm gestiegenen größe des open airs wurde die organisation vom verein rock und kultur am harz e v nach dem festival an die veruga gmbh übertragen die firma war von thorsten kohlrausch für die festivalorganisation gegründet worden der somit anstelle des vereins rock und kultur am harz e v zum veranstalter wurde der verein blieb dennoch bis am rockharz beteiligt zum beispiel mit der betreuung der infostände und der organisation von fünf newcomer bands im programm kamen einige große bands wie in extremo kreator oomph asp und clawfinger zum line up hinzu und gewannen so neue fans für das rockharz dark at dawn die band von veranstalter thorsten kohlrausch gaben auf dem rockharz ihr abschiedskonzert im gleichen jahr war das rockharz erneut von unwettern betroffen zelte wurden zerstört und schlamm behinderte die zuschauer im jahr wurde das festival auf drei tage ausgeweitet entsprechend konnte die setlist mit einer höheren bandanzahl erweitert werden mittlerweile traten im rahmen des festivals bands auf neuer veranstaltungsort ballenstedt seit die größe des festivals erforderte mittlerweile einen neuen veranstaltungsort da in osterode und dessen ortsteilen keine geeigneten flächen für die immer weiter steigenden besucherzahlen vorhanden waren auch die weite strecke zwischen dem festivalgelände in osterode förste und dem campinggelände in osterode dorste die voneinander km entfernt lagen und durch einen shuttlebus service miteinander verbunden waren erwies sich als hinderlich eine neue location wurde mit dem verkehrslandeplatz ballenstedt harz gefunden der sowohl über geeignetes terrain für umfangreiche bühnenbauten als auch über genügend platz für die zelte der besucher verfügt außerdem sind größere ortschaften nun etwas entfernt was beschwerden wegen lärms minimiert leider war auch gleich wieder der auftakt an der neuen veranstaltungsstätte von schlechtem wetter betroffen es regnete an zwei von drei veranstaltungstagen im folgejahr herrschte hingegen mit c große hitze während des festivals konnte das rockharz headliner wie hypocrisy hammerfall oder in extremo aufbieten seit ist der zuspruch des publikums so groß dass das festival seitdem jährlich ausverkauft ist von bis fand im vorfeld des rockharz open air ein ausscheidungswettkampf von nachwuchsbands in osterode statt diesen devil s wall trophy genannten wettbewerb gewann im jahr die metalcore band five feet high and rising furious anger in den folgejahren entschieden die bands harmann und asenblut das rennen für sich die gewinner bands erspielten sich so einen slot für einen auftritt an einem nachmittag des rockharz beim festival war die anreisesituation durch straßenbaustellen und einlass restriktionen so ungünstig dass es zu einem rückstau von bis zu km auf den zufahrtsstraßen kam der veranstalter stellte daraufhin maßnahmen vor um dies in zukunft zu vermeiden dazu gehört die möglichkeit einen tag früher anzureisen die schaffung einer zweiten zufahrtsstraße reservierungen von stellflächen und beschleunigte kontrollen durch die security seit erhalten besucher die zur abreise das müllpfand einlösen indem sie ihren gesammelten müll abgeben ein aktuelles luftbildposter des rockharz festivals dabei wird jedes jahr ein neues luftbild erstellt um potentielle besucher möglichst früh zum ticketkauf zu animieren werden verschiedene limitierte frühbucherpakete angeboten die als extras zum beispiel eine dvd mit zusammenschnitten aus dem vorjahresfestival poster oder auch t shirts mit rockharz motiven enthalten warm up day ab dem jahr wurden die bandauftritte auf den donnerstag ausgedehnt der schon vorher mit einer metal disco als warm up diente seit ist der donnerstag regulärer festivaltag und es wird stattdessen am mittwoch vor dem festivalbeginn am folgenden tag ein warm up day veranstaltet bis traten auf einer eigenen bühne der devil s wall stage jeweils bis zu sechs bands auf vom infield wurden an diesem tag nur die bereiche vor dieser bühne geöffnet die devil s wall stage wurde nach diesem tag demontiert seit werden die auftritte am mittwoch auch als afm label night zusammengefasst da die veranstalter dafür mit dem independent label afm records kooperieren und die am mittwoch auftretenden bands alle bei diesem label unter vertrag stehen fand die afm label night direkt auf einer der beiden hauptbühnen der rock stage statt auf eine dritte bühne die lediglich einen tag benutzt wird wurde dabei verzichtet organisation das rockharz open air wurde von seiner gründung bis zum jahr vom verein rock und kultur am harz e v auf ehrenamtlicher basis organisiert das festival wurde danach als zu groß für ein rein ehrenamtliches engagement angesehen auch die absicherung unternehmerischer risiken erforderte eine neue lösung seit veranstaltet deshalb die zu diesem zweck gegründete veruga gmbh veranstaltungs gastronomie gmbh das rockharz open air ganzjährig mit der organisation des festivals sind etwa fünf mitarbeiter beschäftigt unmittelbar vor und während des festivals erhöht sich die mitarbeiterzahl auf etwa das rockharz weist mittlerweile besucher auf stand der zeltplatz nimmt hektar fläche ein und wird mit km bauzaun umzäunt stand insgesamt stehen hektar zur verfügung anwohner der beiden nächstgelegenen orte badeborn und ballenstedt erhalten aus einem begrenzen kontingent verbilligte tageskarten für den donnerstag fand auch eine führung durch das festival und über den backstage bereich für interessierte anwohner der beiden orte statt warm up partys ähnlich wie andere festivals wird auch durch die rockharz veranstalter versucht mit warm up partys in den monaten vor dem jährlichen festival in clubs an verschiedenen orten werbung für das open air zu machen spielte die band johnny deathshadow auf einer rockharz warm up party wurden warm up partys in kiel hannover und bremen organisiert wo unter anderem die excrementory grindfuckers spielten wieder in kiel und bremen hier mit orden ogan als headlinern erneut in bremen wo der unter anderem cripper auftraten in kiel und goslar hier mit asenblut und in clausthal zellerfeld oschersleben headliner crossplane knesebeck headliner tempest und kiel irock netzwerk der rockharz veranstalter veruga gmbh ist assoziiertes mitglied im irock netzwerk einem innovations und vertriebsnetzwerk im bereich der open air musikfestivals darin sind verschiedene forschungseinrichtungen und firmen zusammengeschlossen die in für musikfestivals relevanten bereichen wie lärmmessung logistik managementsoftware zapfanlagen oder bühnenkonstruktionen tätig sind beim festival wurde im rahmen einer pressekonferenz unter anderem über das netzwerk informiert dabei wurden von vertretern verschiedener firmen und forschungseinrichtungen einige themenschwerpunkte erläutert veranstaltete das netzwerk auf dem rockharz open air eine messe bei der verschiedene partnerfirmen und ihre produkte vorgestellt wurden auch auf dem festival stellten einige firmen ihre produkte in einer kleinen ausstellung im vip bereich vor kriminalität und unfälle das rockharz open air kann als recht sicher gelten so wurden beim festival bei der polizei lediglich zwei körperverletzungen zwei beschädigungen an pkw sowie der diebstahl eines notstromaggregats und von zehn hühnern aus einem benachbarten garten angezeigt ein jahr später wurde versucht das auf der teufelsmauer fest installierte holzkreuz anzuzünden was jedoch von der vor ort patrouillierenden freiwilligen feuerwehr ballenstedt glücklicherweise ohne größere schäden unterbunden werden konnte wurde eine besucherin schwer verletzt als zwei jugendliche fahrlässig mit flüssigem grillanzünder hantierten im gleichen jahr starb ein kollabierter besucher des festivals nach der vor ort durch sanitäter erfolgten reanimation wenig später im krankenhaus verletzte sich ein besucher beim hantieren mit einem gaskocher schwer soziales engagement seit kooperiert das rockharz open air mit dem rotaract club clausthal zellerfeld der rotaract club ist die jugendorganisation der internationalen rotary bewegung dabei werden spenden durch das projekt glück in dosen gesammelt bei dem die besucher ihre getränkedosen spenden können das dosenpfand wird dann von rotaract bei recycling partnern eingelöst und zur finanziellen unterstützung verschiedener sozialer projekte in der region verwendet so zum beispiel für den rueckenwind e v der unter anderem kindern aus armen osteröder familien täglich ein warmes mittagessen ermöglicht für den urlaubskinder e v der mit seinen kidscamps einen kostenlosen kurzurlaub im zeltlager für kinder möglich macht oder auch für die jugendarbeit von verschiedenen vereinen direkt in ballenstedt in den ersten drei jahren der kooperation konnten über das dosenpfand mehr als euro gesammelt werden häufig auftretende bands im laufe der

de,die nachfolge des präsidenten der vereinigten staaten wird durch die verfassung und den presidential succession act von geregelt aus der verfassung ergibt sich dass falls der präsident aus irgendwelchen gründen aus dem amt scheidet der vizepräsident nachrückt ist dieses amt unbesetzt so ist im presidential succession act eine reihenfolge festgelegt mit der ein kommissarischer präsident bestimmt wird der sprecher des repräsentantenhauses der präsident pro tempore des senats und danach die mitglieder des kabinetts in einer im gesetz festgelegten reihenfolge durch die einfügung des zusatzartikels zur us verfassung wurde die seit geübte praxis kodifiziert dass der vizepräsident bei tod oder rücktritt des präsidenten selbst zum präsidenten wird und nicht nur das amt kommissarisch ausübt weiterhin ermöglicht dieser zusatz die nachnominierung eines vizepräsidenten so dass es seither deutlich unwahrscheinlicher geworden ist dass die liste zur ersatznachfolge des präsidenten zur anwendung kommt in der geschichte der vereinigten staaten gab es bisher noch nicht den fall dass sowohl das amt des präsidenten als auch des vizepräsidenten vakant waren daher rückten immer die vizepräsidenten als präsidenten nach da anders als in parlamentarischen regierungssystemen der präsident im amerikanischen politischen system vom volk gewählt wird durch ein wahlmännerkollegium und eine vorgezogene neuwahl nicht vorgesehen ist bedarf es einer genauen regelung wie mit dem wegfall des präsidenten umzugehen ist eine einfache nachwahl etwa durch das parlament ist nicht möglich andererseits ist eine auch zeitlich lückenlose ersatznachfolge unbedingt erforderlich da der präsident gleichzeitig staatsoberhaupt regierungschef und oberbefehlshaber der streitkräfte ist presidential succession act von da die verfassung der vereinigten staaten nur die direkte nachfolge des vizepräsidenten vorsieht enthielt der ursprüngliche verfassungstext die bestimmung dass der kongress durch einfaches gesetz festlegen kann wie im falle des wegfalls von präsident und vizepräsident weiterverfahren wird diese möglichkeit hat er durch die verabschiedung der drei presidential succession acts und wahrgenommen das derzeit gültige gesetz aus dem jahr ist in title chapter section des united states code der amtlichen sammlung amerikanischen bundesrechts festgehalten unterabsatz a unterabsatz a regelt dass in allen fällen in denen weder präsident noch vizepräsident ihr amt ausüben können der sprecher des repräsentantenhauses als kommissarischer präsident amtiert hierzu muss er jedoch aus diesem parlamentsamt zurücktreten und sein mandat niederlegen der sprecher des repräsentantenhauses ist der gewählte vorsitzende der kammer und insofern dem deutschen bundestagspräsidenten vergleichbar jedoch ist das amt des sprechers nicht überparteilich geprägt anders als das amt des deutschen bundestagspräsidenten sachlich ist das sprecheramt somit eher dem amt des fraktionsvorsitzenden einer großen partei im deutschen bundestag vergleichbar a if by reason of death resignation removal from office inability or failure to qualify there is neither a president nor vice president to discharge the powers and duties of the office of president then the speaker of the house of representatives shall upon his resignation as speaker and as representative in congress act as president the same rule shall apply in the case of the death resignation removal from office or inability of an individual acting as president under this subsection a wenn aufgrund des todes des rücktrittes der amtsenthebung der amtsunfähigkeit oder fehlens der wählbarkeit weder ein präsident noch ein vizepräsident zur verfügung steht um die rechte und pflichten des amtes des präsidenten auszuüben amtiert der sprecher des repräsentantenhauses nach seinem rücktritt als sprecher und als mitglied des repräsentantenhauses als präsident die gleiche regel findet anwendung im

im senat und von seinem mandat als senator zurücktreten präsident des senates ist an sich der vizepräsident der vereinigten staaten dieser übt allerdings ausschließlich im falle einer stimmengleichheit ein stimmrecht aus und sitzt den verhandlungen im senat nur selten selbst vor der senat wählt deswegen den präsidenten pro tempore der auch in der verfassung vorgesehen ist und bei abwesenheit des vizepräsidenten die sitzungen leitet nach einer ungeschriebenen tradition handelt es sich dabei heute stets um den dienstältesten senator der mehrheitspartei dieser überträgt die tatsächliche sitzungsleitung aber meist seinerseits auf einen jüngeren senator b if at the time when under subsection a of this section a speaker is to begin the discharge of the powers and duties of the office of president there is no speaker or the speaker fails to qualify as acting president then the president pro tempore of the senate shall upon his resignation as president pro tempore and as senator act as president b wenn zu der zeit zu welcher nach unterabsatz a dieses absatzes der sprecher des repräsentantenhauses die ausübung der rechte und pflichten des amtes des präsidenten beginnen müsste kein sprecher im amt ist oder wenn dem sprecher die wählbarkeit als amtierender präsident fehlt amtiert der präsident pro tempore des senats nach seinem rücktritt als präsident pro tempore und als senator als präsident unterabsatz c unterabsatz c sieht vor dass ein acting president also die durch dieses gesetz als nachfolger des präsidenten bestimmte person grundsätzlich bis zum ende der amtsperiode die befugnisse des präsidenten ausübt allerdings gibt es zwei ausnahmen von dieser regel wenn präsident oder vizepräsident nur wegen des fehlens der wählbarkeit oder wegen einer amtsunfähigkeit ausgefallen sind übernehmen diese nach beseitigung dieses mangels ihre ämter wieder der englische begriff failure to qualify kann auch bedeuten dass noch kein präsident gewählt ist wenn in der volkswahl kein kandidat die absolute mehrheit der wahlmännerstimmen erhält so wird es aufgabe des repräsentantenhauses einen präsidenten zu wählen kann sich diese kammer jedoch nicht bis zum stichtag für den amtsantritt januar auf einen präsidenten einigen so unterliegt der präsident dem failure to qualify also amtiert für die zeit bis die kammer einen präsidenten gewählt hat ihr bisheriger sprecher als präsident c an individual acting as president under subsection a or subsection b of this section shall continue to act until the expiration of the then current presidential term except that if his discharge of the powers and duties of the office is founded in whole or in part on the failure of both the president elect and the vice president elect to qualify then he shall act only until a president or vice president qualifies and if his discharge of the powers and duties of the office is founded in whole or in part on the inability of the president or vice president then he shall act only until the removal of the disability of one of such individuals c eine person die nach unterabsatz a oder b dieses absatzes als präsident amtiert bleibt amtierender präsident bis zum ende der dann laufenden amtszeit mit folgenden ausnahmen wenn ihre ausübung der rechte und pflichten des amtes vollständig oder teilweise auf dem fehlen der wählbarkeit sowohl des neugewählten präsidenten wie des neugewählten vizepräsidenten beruht so bleibt die person nur solange kommissarischer präsident bis ein präsident oder ein vizepräsident die wählbarkeit erlangt hat wenn ihre ausübung der rechte und pflichten des amtes vollständig oder teilweise auf der amtsunfähigkeit des präsidenten oder vizepräsidenten beruht so bleibt die person nur bis wiederherstellung der amtsfähigkeit einer dieser personen kommissarischer präsident unterabsatz d unterabsatz d definiert ferner was passiert wenn auch der präsident pro tempore des senats das amt nicht ausüben kann in diesem fall wird die liste der minister nach der zeitlichen reihenfolge der gründung der einzelnen ministerien abgearbeitet auch eine solche amtsübernahme bedarf des rücktrittes als minister der durch das ablegen des amtseides automatisch eintritt ein minister der als präsident amtiert bleibt solange im amt bis die amtszeit des präsidenten ausläuft es sei denn dass sich vorher ein präsident vizepräsident sprecher des repräsentantenhauses oder präsident pro tempore des senates findet der dann das amt ausüben kann die wiederherstellung der amtsfähigkeit eines eigentlich höher stehenden ministers beispiel der außenminister war amtsunfähig deshalb wurde der finanzminister kommissarischer präsident danach wird der außenminister wieder amtsfähig beeinträchtigt den kommissarischen präsidenten nicht im beispiel bleibt der finanzminister damit kommissarischer präsident d if by reason of death resignation removal from office inability or failure to qualify there is no president pro tempore to act as president under subsection b of this section then the officer of the united states who is highest on the following list and who is not under disability to discharge the powers and duties of the office of president shall act as president secretary of state secretary of the treasury secretary of defense attorney general secretary of the interior secretary of agriculture secretary of commerce secretary of labor secretary of health and human services secretary of housing and urban development secretary of transportation secretary of energy secretary of education secretary of veterans affairs secretary of homeland security an individual acting as president under this subsection shall continue so to do until the expiration of the then current presidential term but not after a qualified and prior entitled individual is able to act except that the removal of the disability of an individual higher on the list contained in paragraph of this subsection or the ability to qualify on the part of an individual higher on such list shall not terminate his service the taking of the oath of office by an individual specified in the list in paragraph of this subsection shall be held to constitute his resignation from the office by virtue of the holding of which he qualifies to act as president d wenn aufgrund des todes des rücktrittes der amtsenthebung der amtsunfähigkeit oder fehlens der wählbarkeit kein präsident pro tempore zur verfügung steht um nach unterabsatz b als präsident zu amtieren so amtiert derjenige amtsträger der vereinigten staaten der auf der folgenden liste am höchsten steht und nicht gehindert ist die rechte und pflichten des amtes des präsidenten auszuüben als präsident außenminister finanzminister verteidigungsminister generalstaatsanwalt justizminister innenminister landwirtschaftsminister handelsminister arbeitsminister gesundheitsminister bauminister verkehrsminister energieminister bildungsminister kriegsveteranenminister heimatschutzminister eine person die nach diesem unterabsatz als präsident amtiert tut dieses bis zum ende der dann laufenden amtszeit allerdings nicht wenn zuvor eine wählbare und höher eingestufte person amtieren kann mit der ausnahme dass die entfernung der amtsunfähigkeit einer auf der liste nach paragraph dieses unterabsatzes höher eingestuften person oder das erlangen der wählbarkeit einer person die auf ebendieser liste steht die amtszeit des kommissarischen präsidenten nicht beendet die ableistung des amtseides durch eine in der liste nach paragraph dieses unterabsatzes benannte person gilt als rücktritt von dem amt kraft dessen er für das amt des kommissarischen präsidenten wählbar geworden ist unterabsatz e unterabsatz e enthält technische details er sieht vor dass alle kommissarischen präsidenten auch als präsident wählbar sein müssten er schließt damit etwa eingebürgerte bürger die zwar minister aber nicht präsident werden können aus der nachfolgeliste aus weiter muss ein minister schon vor dem beginn der abarbeitung der ministerliste ordnungsgemäß das heißt mit zustimmung des senates ernannt worden sein schließlich ist festgehalten dass der kommissarische präsident das präsidentengehalt bekommt e subsections a b and d of this section shall apply only to such officers as are eligible to the office of president under the constitution subsection d of this section shall apply only to officers appointed by and with the advice and consent of the senate prior to the time of the death resignation removal from office inability or failure to qualify of the president pro tempore and only to officers not under impeachment by the house of representatives at the time the powers and duties of the office of president devolve upon them during the period that any individual acts as president under this section his compensation shall be at the rate then provided by law in the case of the president e die unterabsätze a b und d dieses absatzes finden nur anwendung auf amtsträger die nach der verfassung für das amt des präsidenten wählbar sind unterabsatz d findet nur anwendung auf amtsträger die vor dem zeitpunkt des todes des rücktrittes der amtsenthebung der amtsunfähigkeit oder dem fehlen der wählbarkeit des präsidenten pro tempore mit zustimmung des senates ernannt worden sind und nur auf amtsträger die zum zeitpunkt zu dem die rechte und pflichten des amtes des präsidenten auf sie übergehen nicht vom repräsentantenhaus nach dem impeachment verfahren angeklagt sind während des zeitraums in dem eine person nach diesem absatz als präsident amtiert erhält er das gehalt welches durch gesetz für den präsidenten vorgesehen ist aktuelle reihenfolge nach aktuellem stand würden im falle des ausscheidens von präsident donald trump folgende personen in dieser reihenfolge das amt des präsidenten ausüben stand märz vizepräsident mike pence der sprecher des repräsentantenhauses paul ryan der präsident pro tempore des senats orrin hatch außenminister rex tillerson finanzminister steven mnuchin verteidigungsminister james mattis justizminister jeff sessions innenminister ryan zinke landwirtschaftsminister sonny perdue handelsminister wilbur ross arbeitsminister alexander acosta gesundheitsminister tom price bauminister ben carson verkehrsministerin elaine chao erfüllt als gebürtige chinesin die voraussetzungen für eine nachfolge nicht energieminister rick perry bildungsministerin betsy devos kriegsveteranenminister david shulkin minister für innere sicherheit john f kellyder vizepräsident rückt nach dem zusatzartikel aus dem jahr im falle der endgültigen erledigung des präsidentenamtes in dieses amt nach er wird also präsident und nicht nur kommissarischer präsident engl acting president im falle einer vorübergehenden amtsunfähigkeit des präsidenten wird auch der vizepräsident nur kommissarisch präsident diese frage ob ein vizepräsident beim endgültigen wegfall des präsidenten tatsächlich präsident oder kommissarischer präsident wird war vor dem zusatzartikel verfassungsrechtlich nicht unumstritten gewesen der präzedenzfall von john tyler im jahr und seinen nachfolgern entschied die frage allerdings politisch die seit damals gängige praxis der tatsächlichen amtsnachfolge wurde dann nur noch verfassungsrechtlich kodifiziert jede andere person als der vizepräsident kann unabhängig davon ob der präsident dauerhaft oder nur vorübergehend wegfällt nur kommissarischer präsident sein es handelt sich dabei um eine rein technische unterscheidung er würde nicht in der zählung der präsidenten mitgezählt werden und würde sein amt auch wieder verlieren sofern der ursprünglich gewählte präsident nur vorübergehend amtsunfähig war ein kommissarischer präsident besitzt allerdings die gleichen befugnisse wie der präsident nach dem schon verabschiedeten zusatzartikel wird die kommissarisch geleistete amtszeit auch bei der beschränkung auf zwei amtszeiten eingerechnet ein kommissarischer präsident der mehr als zwei jahre der amtszeit übernommen hat kann nur einmal zum präsidenten gewählt werden wie das analog auch für einen nachgerückten vizepräsidenten gelten würde nach mehrheitlicher rechtsauffassung die allerdings nicht unumstritten ist stehen kommissarische amtsinhaber in der nachfolgelinie wenn sie für ihr eigentliches amt mit zustimmung des senats ernannt worden sind und die voraussetzungen für die wählbarkeit zum präsidenten erfüllen dies spielt eine rolle vor allem beim übergang zwischen zwei präsidentschaften weil die bisherigen kabinettsmitglieder üblicherweise mit amtsantritt eines neuen präsidenten ausscheiden die neuen minister aber erst nach zustimmung des senats ihr amt ausüben können historische entwicklung der präsidentennachfolge die präsidentennachfolge wurde durch den ursprünglichen verfassungstext und drei vom kongress beschlossene einfache gesetze die presidential succession acts von und bestimmt hinzu kamen zwei zusatzartikel zur verfassung der zusatzartikel von und der zusatzartikel von die einfluss auf die präsidentennachfolge nahmen diese verfassungszusätze wurden vom kongress und drei vierteln der amerikanischen bundesstaaten ratifiziert und sind damit bestandteil der amerikanischen verfassung der ursprüngliche verfassungstext von die verfassung der vereinigten staaten sieht im zweiten artikel erster abschnitt des ursprünglichen textes vor dass i n case of the removal of the president from office or of his death resignation or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office the same shall devolve on the vice president and the congress may by law provide for the case of removal death resignation or inability both of the president and vice president declaring what officer shall then act as president and such officer shall act accordingly until the disability be removed or a president shall be elected sollte also der präsident des amtes enthoben werden oder sterben oder zurücktreten oder sollte seine amtsunfähigkeit festgestellt werden geht das amt auf den vizepräsidenten über nicht ganz eindeutig ist ob der vizepräsident auch vollwertiger präsident wird oder nur das amt kommissarisch ausübt ferner regelt der satz dass der kongress durch gesetz vorsorge für den fall des verlustes beider amtsträger treffen kann indem er festlegt welcher amtsträger dann als kommissarischer präsident amtieren soll der zusatzartikel stellte später einige bis dahin umstrittene interpretationen dieses satzes klar sie spielten für die präsidentennachfolge jedoch nie eine rolle diskussionen im ersten kongress im januar kurz vor dem ende der legislaturperiode des ersten kongresses schlug ein ausschuss des repräsentantenhauses vor im falle der notwendigkeit der nachfolge den außenminister amtieren zu lassen da dieses ministerium das älteste war weil zu diesem zeitpunkt jedoch der den federalists ablehnend gegenüberstehende thomas jefferson außenminister war rief dieser vorschlag proteste hervor jefferson wurde schließlich doch noch präsident ein anderer vorschlag war den vertreter des präsidenten pro tempore auch als ersten nachrücker für das präsidentenamt vorzusehen diese idee stieß auf ablehnung da nicht klar war ob der präsident pro tempore weiter senator bliebe und damit die gewaltenteilung unterlaufen werde außerdem wurde noch vorgeschlagen den obersten richter der vereinigten staaten englisch chief justice in die reihenfolge mitaufzunehmen schlussendlich vertagte sich der kongress und überließ das problem dem zweiten kongress presidential succession act von der zweite kongress einigte sich schließlich auf eine fassung die nach dem vizepräsidenten den präsidenten pro tempore des senats dann den sprecher des repräsentantenhauses in der liste sah der chief justice wurde aus gründen der gewaltenteilung außen vor gelassen obwohl gleichzeitig zwei vertreter der legislative in die liste mitaufgenommen wurden bis heute wurde der chief justice nie zu einem potentiellen ersatzmann für den präsidenten john tyler etablierte nach dem tod von william henry harrison als erster nachrückender vizepräsident mit seiner auffassung des verfassungstextes die praxis dass der vizepräsident beim wegfall des präsidenten automatisch selbst präsident wird und nicht nur dessen amtspflichten und rechte wahrnimmt da es keine prozedur zur neubesetzung des vizepräsidentenamtes gab wäre bei tod oder rücktritt des aufgerückten vizepräsidenten ein kommissarischer nachfolger anhand des presidential succession act von bestimmt worden in der zeit zwischen und starben fünf vizepräsidenten einer trat zurück und vier vizepräsidenten folgten dem präsidenten während der laufenden amtszeit ins amt nach insgesamt gab es also zehn zeiträume in denen es keinen vizepräsidenten gab wäre in einem dieser zehn zeiträume der präsident weggefallen so wäre nach dem presidential succession act von der präsident pro tempore des senates kommissarischer präsident geworden der presidential succession act von wurde nie angewandt dennoch gab es einige fälle in denen nicht viel zu seiner anwendung gefehlt hat um ein haar wäre dieser fall eingetreten vizepräsident andrew johnson ein demokrat war dem im april ermordeten republikaner abraham lincoln als präsident ins amt gefolgt lincoln hatte johnson zuvor als geste der nationalen versöhnung nach dem bereits abzusehenden ende des bürgerkriegs als seinen running mate ausgewählt als zwar unionstreuer aber tendenziell südstaatenfreundlicher demokrat hatte johnson in den siegreichen und politisch in der unmittelbaren nachkriegszeit völlig dominanten nordstaaten keine hausmacht er war bei der bevölkerung des nordens das die im krieg hart erkämpfte entmachtung der ehemaligen sklavenhalter nun auch vor ort rigoros durchgesetzt sehen wollte unbeliebt johnson wurde einige zeit später vom repräsentantenhaus angeklagt da er gegen einige schwarzenfreundliche bürgerrechtsgesetze des republikanisch dominierten kongresses sein veto eingelegt hatte bei der entscheidenden abstimmung im senat über die amtsenthebung anfang schließlich verpassten seine gegner die notwendige zweidrittelmehrheit im senat um eine stimme es gibt spekulationen nach denen einige gemäßigt republikanische senatoren die eigentlich für johnsons amtsenthebung gestimmt hätten angesichts seines potentiellen nachfolgers des radikal republikanischen präsidenten pro tempore benjamin wade dem ein allzu extremer wille zur bestrafung des südens unterstellt wurde gegen eine verurteilung johnsons stimmten wade wurden auch ambitionen auf das präsidentenamt nachgesagt und als kommissarischer präsident hätte er bei der wahl im november eine deutlich bessere ausgangsposition gehabt ein zeitungsartikel lautete andrew johnson is innocent because ben wade is guilty of being his successor andrew johnson ist unschuldig weil ben wade schuldig ist sein nachfolger zu sein presidential succession act von beschloss der kongress ein neues gesetz über die nachfolge des präsidenten er entfernte die vorsitzenden der beiden kammern aus der liste und nahm stattdessen die minister auf beginnend mit dem außen dem finanz und dem kriegsminister die reihenfolge entsprach der reihenfolge der gründung der ministerien diese neue reihenfolge erschien politisch sinnvoller da zu diesem zeitpunkt bereits sechs vormalige außenminister auf normalem wege präsident geworden waren jedoch noch kein vorsitzender aus dem kongress und wurde weithin angenommen auch das gesetz von fand nie anwendung obwohl auch zwischen und drei vizepräsidenten starben und drei ihrem präsidenten ins amt nachfolgten zusatzartikel von der zusatzartikel von der im wesentlichen ein neues datum für die vereidigung des präsidenten des vizepräsidenten und der mitglieder des kongresses festsetzt enthält in seinem dritten absatz auch eine regelung dass für den fall des scheiterns einer rechtzeitigen wahl von präsident und vizepräsident der kongress bestimmen kann wer das amt des präsidenten kommissarisch ausübt bis ein regulärer kandidat in das amt gewählt wurde dies ist neben dem ursprünglichen verfassungstext die zweite stelle in der amerikanischen verfassung die den presidential succession act zur näheren bestimmung des verfassungswortlautes vorsieht der zusatzartikel war jedoch keine voraussetzung für die verabschiedung des presidential succession acts von presidential succession act von nach dem zweiten weltkrieg und dem tode von präsident franklin d roosevelt unterstützte präsident harry s truman aktiv eine neue nachfolgegesetzgebung die schließlich zum aktuellen presidential succession act führte dabei wurden die vorsitzenden der beiden kongresskammern erneut eingefügt diesmal jedoch in der reihenfolge sprecher des repräsentantenhauses vor präsident pro tempore des senates die kabinettsmitglieder folgten in der reihenfolge der entstehung ihrer ministerien wobei das verteidigungsministerium den platz des kriegsministeriums einnahm zusatzartikel von im zusatzartikel wurde nach fast jahren eine möglichkeit geschaffen nachträglich einen vizepräsidenten zu ernennen wenn beide häuser des kongresses einem solchen vorschlag zustimmen außerdem wurde endgültig festgelegt dass ein nachrückender vizepräsident zu einem vollwertigen präsidenten wird diese änderung erfolgte in der zeit nach der ermordung john f kennedys und stellte zudem einige weitere fragen insbesondere nach der feststellung der amtsunfähigkeit des präsidenten verfassungsrechtlich klar die reihenfolge der möglichen nachfolger wurde durch den zusatzartikel zwar nicht verändert er reduzierte jedoch die wahrscheinlichkeit einer vakanz der beiden höchsten ämter und damit auch der notwendigkeit einer anwendung der weiteren nachfolgeregelungen war es zuvor mehrfach vorgekommen dass das amt des vizepräsidenten über mehrere jahre in john tylers fall fast jahre vakant war konnte die neubesetzung des vizepräsidentenamts nun in jedem falle innerhalb weniger wochen oder monate erfolgen selbst bei einer doppelten vakanz könnte der kommissarische präsident einen neuen vizepräsidenten vorschlagen der nach erfolgreicher bestätigung durch den kongress und rücktritt des kommissarischen präsidenten zum regulären präsidenten aufsteigen würde der zusatzartikel gibt dem präsidenten weiterhin die möglichkeit seine vorübergehende amtsunfähigkeit zu erklären wodurch der vizepräsident das amt kommissarisch übernimmt dies wurde von ronald reagan und george w bush angewendet als sie sich medizinischen behandlungen unterzogen anwendungen und änderungen seit auch der presidential succession act von ist bisher nie tatsächlich zur anwendung gekommen nach dem tod john f kennedys war das amt des vizepräsidenten knapp eineinhalb jahre unbesetzt da lyndon b johnson kennedy ins amt nachgefolgt war und ein vizepräsident noch nicht nachnominiert werden konnte der zusatzartikel wurde erst vier jahre später verabschiedet mitte der er jahre in der endphase der amtszeit richard nixons gab es zwei weitere situationen in denen der sprecher des repräsentantenhauses dem präsidenten ins amt nachgefolgt wäre im oktober war vizepräsident spiro agnew wegen eines bestechungsskandals zurückgetreten erst im dezember wurde gerald ford zum neuen vizepräsidenten ernannt in dieser zeit erwartete man allgemein dass präsident nixon im zuge der watergate affäre zurücktreten würde in diesem fall wäre mit dem demokratischen sprecher des repräsentantenhauses carl albert ein politischer gegner des bisherigen präsidenten ins amt gekommen albert war der ansicht dass er kein recht habe ein amt das die wähler einem republikaner anvertraut hätten auszuüben und kündigte für den fall seiner kommissarischen präsidentschaft an bald einen republikanischen vizepräsidenten zu ernennen und anschließend zu dessen gunsten zurückzutreten auch wenn der fall so nicht eintrat wird alberts ankündigung als wichtiger präzedenzfall angesehen mit dem rücktritt richard nixons im august und dem nachrücken fords ins präsidentenamt wurde das amt des vizepräsidenten erneut vakant erst im dezember wurde nelson rockefeller als vizepräsident vereidigt beim attentat auf ronald reagan am märz war vizepräsident george bush gerade im heimischen texas und außenminister alexander haig rief sich wenige stunden nach dem anschlag vor laufenden fernsehkameras im weißen haus zum verfassungsmäßigen amtsinhaber aus dies sorgte für erhebliches befremden die situation wurde dadurch bereinigt dass bush am abend des gleichen tages die amtsgeschäfte bis zu reagans genesung übernahm der presidential succession act ist seit einige male geändert worden um änderungen der ministerialstruktur abzubilden beziehungsweise neu geschaffene ministerien am ende der liste einzufügen nach den terroranschlägen vom september wurden einige potenzielle nachfolger wie der sprecher des repräsentantenhauses dennis hastert an sichere orte gebracht um die nachfolge abzusichern viele abgeordnete wollten in der folge der terroranschläge die einfügung des neuen ministeriums für innere sicherheit in einer höheren position als am ende der liste erreichen und argumentierten dass der minister für innere sicherheit in einem solchen notstandsfall für das amt des kommissarischen präsidenten besser geeignet wäre als etwa der bauminister tatsächlich wurde der minister für innere sicherheit kurzzeitig nach dem justizminister an achter stelle der nachfolge eingefügt doch dieses gesetz endete mit der amtszeit des kongresses und wurde seither nicht wieder eingebracht durch die house resolution wurde der presidential succession act am märz zum bislang letzten mal dahingehend ergänzt den minister für innere sicherheit nun wieder am ende der reihenfolge hinter dem minister für kriegsveteranen in die nachfolgeregelung aufzunehmen verfassungsrechtliche diskussion einige bedeutende amerikanische verfassungsrechtler wie akhil reed amar bezweifeln die verfassungsmäßigkeit der aufnahme des sprechers des repräsentantenhauses und des präsidenten pro tempore des senats in die liste sie argumentieren dass der begriff officer im verfassungsrechtlichen sinne nur angehörige der exekutive und der judikative nicht jedoch der legislative umfasse ferner hatte schon james madison ausdrücklich auf die gewaltenteilung verwiesen in diesem zusammenhang sei die einbeziehung von personen aus einer anderen gewalt als der exekutive in eine nachfolgeregelung für die exekutive verfassungsrechtlich fragwürdig vorkehrungen für das ausreichen der liste zur sicherstellung dass mindestens ein amtsträger der liste auch im schlimmsten fall überlebt wird seit für den fall der zusammenkunft vieler listenmitglieder eine person als designated survivor notfallüberlebender bestimmt der sich weitab von washington für den fall eines terroranschlages oder großen unfalls zur übernahme des präsidentenamtes bereithält ein solcher designated survivor wird regelmäßig für die rede zur lage der nation bestimmt bei der ansonsten der vizepräsident alle kabinettsmitglieder und die mitglieder des kongresses anwesend sind jedoch wird von jeder partei und von jedem haus je ein abgeordneter als weiterer designated survivor bestimmt sodass diese vier personen im notfall die vorsteher ihres hauses wählen könnten welche danach unverzüglich das amt als kommissarischer präsident anträten sollten jedoch auch diese personen umkommen gibt es keine ausdrücklichen regelungen wer dann die nachfolge antritt stellvertretende minister kämen nicht in frage da sich die nachfolgeregelung ausdrücklich auf vollwertige kabinettsmitglieder bezieht siehe liste der designated survivors fiktionale anwendung der präsidentennachfolge über den vizepräsidenten hinaus die übernahme des präsidentenamtes durch den vizepräsidenten erscheint in vielen amerikanischen print und filmerzeugnissen seltener dagegen sind die werke in denen über den vizepräsidenten hinaus die amtsnachfolge besprochen wird mithin der presidential succession act als solcher angewandt wird im roman the man von irving wallace aus dem jahr also noch vor der ratifikation des zusatzartikels stirbt der vizepräsident an einem herzinfarkt der präsident und der sprecher des repräsentantenhauses sterben beide bei einem unfall in europa sodass der präsident pro tempore des senates ein afroamerikaner kommissarischer präsident wird konservative mitglieder beider parteien finden schnell vorwände ihn des amtes zu entheben der roman wurde verfilmt line of succession von brian garfield enthält das szenario dass zwischen dem tag der wahl und dem der vereidigung der designierte präsident der designierte vizepräsident und der sprecher des repräsentantenhauses durch terroristen getötet werden der präsident pro tempore gilt als inakzeptabel für das amt des präsidenten deshalb versucht der noch im amt befindliche abgewählte präsident im amt zu bleiben im roman thirty four east von alfred coppel aus dem jahr wird der vizepräsident von arabischen terroristen entführt gleichzeitig kommt der präsident bei einem flugzeugabsturz ums leben da der vizepräsident offenbar amtsunfähig ist übernimmt der sprecher des repräsentantenhauses als kommissarischer präsident die macht er wird dabei aber als schwacher charakter dargestellt der vom stabschef manipuliert wird im roman trinity s child von william prochnau aus dem jahr als by dawn s early light verfilmt fällt washington einem nuklearangriff zum opfer bei dem das halbe kabinett stirbt der innenminister übernimmt die präsidentschaft und führt den dritten weltkrieg fort es stellt sich jedoch heraus dass der präsident noch lebt allerdings

repräsentantenhauses die kommissarische präsidentschaft bis der präsident nach der rettung seiner tochter sein amt wieder übernimmt in der fernsehserie welcome mrs president aus dem jahr erleidet die präsidentin einen blinddarmdurchbruch ähnlich wie beim vorherigen beispiel ist auch hier der vizepräsident kurz zuvor zurückgetreten so dass der oppositionelle sprecher des repräsentantenhauses die präsidentschaft übernimmt nach der entlassung aus dem krankenhaus kehrt die präsidentin in ihr amt zurück im film xxx the next level plant der us verteidigungsminister einen militärputsch bei dem der präsident und alle vor ihm stehenden nachfolger des präsidenten getötet werden sollen damit er selbst nächster us präsident werden kann als nachfolger auf einem schaubild genannt werden explizit aber

im film olympus has fallen die welt in gefahr aus dem jahr kommt es zu einem überfall von terroristen die dabei das weiße haus in ihre gewalt bringen können der präsident und andere hochrangige

it,il duca leto atreides i è un personaggio del romanzo di fantascienza dune padre del protagonista paul atreides jurgen prochnow e william hurt lo hanno interpretato rispettivamente nel film del e nella miniserie per la tv che sono stati tratti dal romanzo il personaggio è stato ripreso da kevin j anderson e da brian herbert nel loro ciclo di romanzi del preludio a dune in cui ne narrano in dettaglio la giovinezza nel preludio a dune leto atreides nasce nel sul pianeta caladan figlio del duca paulus atreides e di helena richese atreides sua madre è una nipote dell imperatore elrood ix nel sedicenne si reca sul pianeta ix secondo il volere del padre per studiare lungo un anno presso la casa vernius guidata dal famoso ed eroico conte dominic amico di paulus e padre dei giovani kailea e rombhur durante la sua permanenza sul pianeta leto assiste alla ribellione di suboidi creature del bene tleilax i quali seminano caos e disordine favorendo l invasione dei nauseaondi tleilaxu che conquistano ix ribattezzandolo xuttuh la casa verinus viene deposta e costretta a fuggire leto ritorna su caladan con kailea e rombhur ai quali il duca paulus offre generosamente asilo politico nello stesso anno il padre paulus atreides muore nell arena delle corride durante una sua esibizione contro un toro salusano drogato leto diviene ufficialmente il duca di caladan ben presto il giovane duca scopre che la morte del padre è stata pilotata dalla madre la duchessa helena che è a sua volta solo una pedina delle trame della casa harkonnen rivale degli atreides negli anni leto atreides prende le difese in seno al landsraad dei suoi amici gli eredi vernius attirandosi l antipatia delle altre dinastie in quanto difensore di una casata rinnegata nemico dichiarato del bene tleilax leto mentre si reca a kaitain per assistere all incoronazione del nuovo imperatore shaddam iv viene ritenuto responsabile dell attacco a due navi tleilaxu in realtà avvenuto per mano degli harkonnen tramite una nave invisibile durante un processo per decadenza istituzione quasi mai invocata il duca viene riconosciuto innocente per mancanza di prove ma soprattutto a causa dell intervento del principe ereditario shaddam in realtà il pretendente al trono ha scoperto che leto è venuto a conoscenza del progetto segretissimo chiamato amal che ha luogo su ix e gestito dai corrino stessi al fine di riprodurre la spezia di arrakis isolando lo stesso mondo delle sabbie il duca leto acquisisce nel tempo un grandissimo rispetto tra le grandi case feudali dell impero di shaddam iv in quanto svolge con successo la funzione di mediatore in difficili controversie tra le grandi case del landsraad come per esempio durante la crisi tra la casa moritani e la casa ecaz ciò gli attira tuttavia la gelosia del barone vladimir harkonnen antico rivale del padre paulus e la paura del sovrano shaddam iv leto ha un figlio da kailea vernius victor nonostante l amore che prova per entrambi non può né sposare kailea erede di una casa rinnegata e nemmeno dichiarare il bambino come suo erede al ducato per la stessa ragione accecata dall ira kailea organizza un incidente aereo per uccidere leto e proclamare victor suo erede leto sopravvive all incidente mentre perde la vita il piccolo victor dopo il suicidio di kailea il duca prende jessica una bene gesserit come sua concubina ufficiale dalla quale ottiene un figlio paul atreides sua figlia alia viene concepita un mese prima della sua morte la sua esistenza quindi non è mai stata nota a leto detto anche duca rosso leto su consiglio del padre paulus e aiutato dal fedelissimo thufir hawat passa per anni in rassegna le sue possibili mogli analizzando le opportunità politiche derivanti dal matrimonio senza però mai trovare l adeguato contratto matrimoniale in dune nel il duce leto atreides riceve dall imperatore il comando di trasferirsi sul pianeta arrakis prendendo il posto degli avversari harkonnen nella raccolta della preziosissima spezia il mandato offertogli si rivela in realtà una trappola mortale gli harkonnen attaccano arrakis senza preavviso con il supporto di truppe imperiali sardaukar travestite lo stesso leto rimane ucciso nel corso dell invasione dopo essere stato catturato dagli harkonnen nel disperato tentativo di assassinare il barone vladimir harkonnen la notizia della sua morte suscita l ira dell imperatore shaddam iv che non ne voleva l uccisione ma solo il ridimensionamento del potere della casa atreides in seno al landsraad il figlio paul atreides scampato con la madre lady jessica giura sull anello del padre che lo vendicherà quando leto muore lady jessica è da un mese in attesa della secondogenita alia la quale a seguito della cerimonia sacra dell acqua della vita a cui si era sottoposta lady jessica mentre la portava in grembo si manifesta come prenata ovvero nella terminologia bene gesserit un abominazione la sua condizione di prenata consentirà ad alia di aiutare il fratello nella vendetta conto il barone vladimir harkonnen e l imperatore shaddam iv

it,la battaglia di ragogna fu uno scontro verificatosi nella prima guerra mondiale tra il regio esercito italiano da una parte e l imperial regio esercito austro ungarico e il deutsches heer dall altra in seguito alla battaglia di caporetto l episodio rappresenta l ultimo atto di difesa del tagliamento da parte degli italiani che sebbene non riuscirono nel loro scopo rallentarono di qualche giorno l offensiva nemica dando così tempo ad altri reparti di ritirarsi verso il fiume piave premesse lo sfondamento delle truppe austro tedesche a caporetto il ottobre costrinse gli italiani a ritirarsi sul fiume tagliamento designato da luigi cadorna comandante supremo del regio esercito come linea difensiva il ottobre il generale antonino di giorgio si vide incaricato di disporre la e divisione tra trasaghis e dignano per mantenere il collegamento strategico tra il xii corpo d armata della carnia e la armata ma soprattutto per coprire l eventuale ritirata che verrà decisa il giorno dopo dei soldati schierati sulla linea monte kuk monte vodice sella di dol monte santo salcano poco più a est del tagliamento arrivato a pinzano al tagliamento il ottobre il generale posizionò la divisione tra trasaghis e cornino e la tra cornino e dignano dove è anche situato il monte ragogna alto solo m presto le divisioni di fanteria austro ungariche sch tzen e ruppero le difese impostate ad est del tagliamento e puntarono verso il ponte di cornino mentre l alpenkorps procedette per il ponte di bonzicco una frazione di dignano nel frattempo la armata italiana dalla quale dipendevano il gruppo volo ed il gruppo caccia venne divisa in tre settori e a quello di sinistra nord comandato dal generale donato etna venne ordinato di impostare una testa di ponte presso ragogna alla divisione di di giorgio si aggiunse così il ottobre la brigata bologna agli ordini del colonnello carlo rocca e quattro battaglioni della brigata barletta che immediatamente iniziarono i lavori per creare opere difensive anche se mancavano del tutto i collegamenti telefonici vennero inoltre fatti arrivare una trentina di cannoni che andarono a posizionarsi sulla riva destra del tagliamento mentre altri circa presero posizione vicino a forgaria nel friuli anche se le munizioni disponibili erano molto ridotte storia la battaglia di ragogna il ottobre fu il giorno della svolta la divisione di fanteria slesiana una volta conquistata definitivamente san daniele del friuli svoltò in direzione dei ponti di pinzano al tagliamento e cornino ma venne fermata nei pressi del monte ragogna l alpenkorps intanto veduto distrutto dai genieri italiani il ponte di bonzicco arrestò la sua avanzata mentre gli austro ungarici a cornino difesa dagli uomini delle brigate genova siracusa lombardia da due battaglioni della lario e da pochi pezzi di artiglieria il cui ponte era stato fatto saltare come quello di bonzicco diressero per ragogna la mattina del ottobre queste forze in aggiunta alla slesiana oltrepassarono dopo lunghi combattimenti la frazione ragognese di muris peraltro persa quasi subito a seguito di un contrattacco italiano il ottobre entrò in azione alle ore l artiglieria austro tedesca intesa come fase preliminare per l attacco delle fanterie che si verificò tre ore dopo riscontrando inizialmente pochi successi che tramutarono poi a causa della superiorità numerica in isolati successi gli italiani si ritirarono nella frazione san pietro e un reggimento della slesiana riuscì a raggiungere il ponte di pinzano al tagliamento ma dovette ritirarsi perché attaccato alle spalle dalle mitragliatrici del regio esercito appostate sul monte ragogna nelle prime ore del novembre i soldati di cornino si ritirarono sulla riva destra del tagliamento per permettere ai genieri di demolire il ponte ma la scarsa qualità dell esplosivo permise solamente di danneggiare l arcata occidentale al monte di ragogna la situazione per la brigata bologna divenne sempre più critica ed il generale carlo sanna comandante della divisione nonché responsabile della distruzione del ponte di pinzano al tagliamento viste le truppe austro tedesche che si avvicinavano sempre di più supportate per giunta dall artiglieria che avrebbe potuto interrompere i fili elettrici delle cariche attorno alle diede l ordine di far saltare il grande ponte impedendone l attraversamento sia agli italiani che agli austro tedeschi i soldati italiani rimasti intrappolati sulla riva sinistra del tagliamento comunque non si arresero fino a sera poi i superstiti soldati e ufficiali si consegnarono al nemico in giornata era stata anche seriamente danneggiata dai genieri italiani la passerella di pontaiba frazione di pinzano al tagliamento che risultò quindi impraticabile ai soldati di otto von below la presa del ponte di cornino terminati gli scontri a ragogna i soldati austriaci convergettero per cornino dove il ponte ancora era rimasto in piedi sfruttando la debolezza delle brigate italiane essi conquistarono le posizioni della lombardia sulla riva destra del tagliamento il novembre e respinsero i contrattacchi delle brigate lario e barletta susseguitesi fino al giorno dopo non più difese ad est della loro posizione la e divisione italiana in ritirata dalle prealpi carniche vennero completamente accerchiate dopo la battaglia terminata la battaglia le artiglierie italiane proseguirono a colpire la riva sinistra del tagliamento causando tra l altro la morte di prigionieri italiani alloggiati in una casa colpita da un proiettile ai superstiti della bologna tra cui vi era il colonnello rocca venne concesso l onore delle armi e del loro valore si parlò anche nei bollettini di guerra tedeschi cadorna non appena venne a sapere della caduta di cornino ordinò all intero esercito di ripiegare sul fiume piave sul quale nel frattempo si erano fatti passi avanti nell impostazione di una linea difensiva anche a ragogna come a caporetto non mancarono gli errori dei generali la bologna

it,la maina m ni in greco è una sub regione geografica e culturale della grecia che occupa la penisola centrale delle tre che si estendono verso sud dal peloponneso nella grecia meridionale la penisola è popolarmente detta il dito medio la penisola forma la continuazione della catena montuosa del taigeto la spina centrale del peloponneso che si estende fra il golfo di laconia ad est e il golfo messenico a ovest l insediamento umano nella penisola è sparso in centri abitati molto piccoli e isolati il più importante dei quali è storicamente areopoli tradizionalmente considerata la capitale della maina mentre l abitato più popoloso è oggi gytheio porto principale della regione la comunità che vi è insediata prende il nome di manioti m mani tes in greco ed è nota per una lunga storia di fiera autonomia e di forte attaccamento a tradizioni che il sentimento comunitario riconduce alla permanenza dell elemento dorico nell ethos locale testimoniato anche dalla peculiarità dialettali geografia la penisola della maina che si dirama dalla catena montuosa del taigeto m di altezza s l m e dai suoi contrafforti verso mezzogiorno ha inizio a sud della città di kalamata e finisce nel mar ionio con il promontorio detto capo matapan o capo tenaro quest ultimo si trova ad una latitudine più meridionale della città di tunisi ed è dopo tarifa spagna la punta continentale più meridionale d europa il territorio è montagnoso e inaccessibile si pensa che il nome mani abbia il significato originario di secco o privo di alberi fino a tempi recenti molti villaggi potevano essere raggiunti soltanto via mare oggi una strada stretta e tortuosa si estende lungo la costa occidentale da kalamata ad areopoli quindi punta verso sud fino al capo matapan e infine gira a nord per raggiungere gytheio la penisola è amministrativamente ma anche storicamente suddivisa in due parti la maina esterna e quella interna la prima appartiene alla messenia mentre la seconda alla regione storica della laconia oggi distinte unità periferiche della regione del peloponneso nell età classica invece l intera maina rientrava nella laconia dominata da sparta alla cui eredità ancora oggi i mainoti si ricollegano culturalmente dopo la riforma amministrativa detta piano kallikratis in vigore dal gennaio che ha abolito le prefetture e accorpato numerosi comuni la maina esterna costituisce il comune di dytiki mani in greco ovvero maina occidentale con abitanti secondo i dati del censimento e superficie di km mentre la maina interna rientra nel comune di anatoliki mani in greco ovvero maina orientale con popolazione di abitanti secondo i dati del censimento e superficie di km la maina storica pertanto ha una superficie complessiva di km e una popolazione totale di abitanti la maina orientale o esterna è più piovosa della maina occidentale o interna e per questa ragione la prima è popolarmente detta anche aposkiaderi espressione locale che significa ombrosa mentre la seconda è popolarmente chiamata prosiliaki che significa soleggiata molti cognomi della maina orientale o esterna terminano con il suffisso éas mentre il suffisso tipico dei cognomi della maina occidentale o interna è kos altro suffisso tipico della maina è óggonas una corruzione dell originario éggonos nipote di nonno alla divisione tradizionale in due territori oggi consacrata dalla distribuzione della

quarta suddivisione denominata vardounia nel nord corrispondente al soppresso comune di smynos che la riforma amministrativa detta piano kallikratis ha ricompreso nel comune di anatoliki mani storia la poco accessibile penisola della maina è stata caratterizzata nel corso della sua storia dall autonomia rispetto alle potenze vicine e da peculiari forme di cultura il cristianesimo per esempio vi giunse tardi rispetto al resto del peloponneso mettendovi radici soltanto nel ix secolo sebbene esistessero già in precedenza alcune chiese in luoghi fortificati anche per la persistenza di credenze pagane e forse criptogiudaiche il mani era contraddistinto da una notevolissima tradizione folkloristica di spiriti demoni centauri vampiri nereidi ed altri miti paganeggianti o sincreticamente accolti nella religiosità popolare ortodossa la maina inoltre grazie alla sua impraticabilità costituì fino al xx secolo un luogo di rifugio per molti greci e occidentali riottosi al dominio dell impero ottomano vi si stanziarono infatti popolazioni greco bizantine franco greche e veneto cretesi dopo la conquista turca delle loro terre incluse le loro aristocrazie i cui membri nel mani vennero denominati nikliani questi nobili spesso molto poveri decaduti e dediti a pratiche di pirateria e brigantaggio vivevano in case torri e formarono complesse strutture claniche sovente impegnate in faide si consideravano socialmente superiori alla plebe anche se spesso ne condividevano le professioni e lo stile di vita e se ne differenziavano soltanto per il diritto di vivere in case torri e di ornare i loro tetti con tegole di marmo anche se spesso semi analfabete e prive di un accurata registrazione genealogica vantavano origini che risalivano fino alle dinastie dei paleologhi o dei commeno e delle altre grandi dinastie imperiali bizantine e dei duchi franco greci convertiti all ortodossia si tratta di una delle pochissime tracce di aristocrazia tradizionale rimaste in grecia dopo il dominio turco e in effetti tutta l altra nobiltà medievale moderna greca ha origine nella nobiltà franca e crociata o dal patriziato italiano veneziano soprattutto nelle isole jonie e a creta genovese nell arcipelago oppure trattasi di nobiltà di cappa fanariota ovvero discende da quella nobiltà bizantina che accettò la supremazia turca e continuò a vivere a costantinopoli sul danubio e in asia minore a nessuna delle potenze occupanti riuscì nel corso dei secoli di sottomettere i manioti essi rimasero sempre liberi selvaggi imprevedibili ed in perenne lite fra di loro faide famigliari durate generazioni segnarono la loro impronta sui manioti così come rivolte e pratiche piratesche e di grande brigantaggio ai danni dei mercanti soprattutto turchi e sudditi dell impero ottomano armeni ebrei di salonicco siro libanesi fu proprio da questa regione che ebbe gli inizi il movimento di liberazione dei greci dal giogo turco che durava da quattro secoli del resto dal xviii secolo in poi i turchi avevano rinunciato al controllo diretto del mani eccetto un paio di fortezze demandandolo a un bey scelto tra le famiglie locali mai tramandato di padre in figlio che governava in maniera semi indipendente o talvolta completamente indipendente e ribelle assieme alle isole jonie e al monte athos il mani dunque era l unica parte della grecia che si situava al di fuori del diretto controllo ottomano la fiera difesa della propria autonomia da parte dei manioti è stata spesso ricondotta alle loro lontane origini spartane ed era rappresentata anche visivamente dalle tipiche case torri medievali che costellano ancora oggi il paesaggio urbano locale e dalle quali i clan familiari nei quali erano organizzati si difendevano contro gli ottomani e i crociati o si attaccavano fra loro in occasione delle molte guerre tribali il tema della discendenza dagli antichi spartiati ha accompagnato la definizione dei manioti per gran parte della loro storia come attestato da napoleone bonaparte che si riferiva loro come discendenti di sparta o da theodoros kolokotronis leader della guerra di indipendenza greca che li chiamava gli spartani nei primi secoli dell età moderna i manioti furono anche famigerati pirati e il porto di oitylo ebbe il soprannome ironico di grande algeri le origini periodo miceneo omero nel catalogo delle navi contenuto nel secondo libro dell iliade menziona le città della maina messi mezapos oetylus oitylo kardamili o skardamoula gerenia teuthone kotronas e las passavas sotto i micenei la maina ebbe la sua prima fioritura e un famoso tempio dedicato ad apollo fu costruito sul capo tenaro o capo matapan il tempio era di tale importanza da rivaleggiare con il complesso sacro di delfi che era allora dedicato a poseidone alla fine il tempio di tenaro fu dedicato a poseidone e quello di delfi notoriamente ad apollo secondo la leggenda vi era una caverna nei pressi del tenaro che conduceva all ade la maina appare anche in altri racconti mitologici come quello famosissimo di elena di troia la quale avrebbe trascorso la sua prima notte con il rapitore paride sull isoletta di cranae al largo della costa di gytheio durante il xii secolo a c i dori invasero la laconia e si insediarono originariamente a sparta ma ben presto cominciarono ad espandere il loro territorio e intorno all a c occuparono la maina con tutto il resto della laconia i manioti furono ascritti fra i perieci nello stesso periodo i fenici giunsero nella maina e stabilirono una loro colonia a gytheio roman name gytheio che costituiva una buona base per la raccolta della murex la conchiglia marina usata per la produzione della porpora di cui era ricco il golfo di laconia età classica mentre gli spartani governavano la maina tenaro divenne un importante luogo di riunione per i mercenari gytheio divenne un porto di primario rilievo per sparta da cui dista soltanto chilometri miglia nel a c durante la prima guerra del peloponneso fu assediato e catturato dall ammiraglio ateniese tolmide con triremi e opliti la città e i moli vennero ricostruiti e nella tarda guerra del peloponneso e gytheio divenne il primo cantiere navale per la nuova flotta spartana la leadership spartana sul peloponneso ebbe una brusca battuta d arresto nel a c quando i tebani condotti da epaminonda li sconfissero nella leuttra i tebani durante la campagna per la sottomissione della laconia conquistarono gytheio dopo un assedio di tre giorni ma la mantennero per poco e alla fine furono cacciati da una unità d élite composta da spartiati età ellenistica nel periodo ellenistico la maina rimase sotto il controllo degli spartani i macedoni sotto il commando di filippo v di macedonia invasero la maina e la laconia nel a c a c e assediarono senza successo gytheio las e asine quando nabide salì al trono di sparta nel a c introdusse alcune limitate riforme in senso democratico ampliando notevolmente la base degli spartiati ormai ridotti a poco più di un centinaio di unità fra l altro il nuovo re rafforzò gytheio facendone un porto e un arsenale di prima grandezza nel a c durante la guerra romano spartana la repubblica romana e la lega achea con il supporto di un contingente misto fornito dal regno di pergamo e da rodi prese gytheio dopo un lungo assedio gli alleati giunsero ad assediare la stessa sparta e costrinsero nabide ad arrendersi fra le clausole del trattato vi era l imposizione dell autonomia di gytheio e di altri villaggi perieci fra i quali molti insediamenti costieri della maina questi fondarono la comunità dei laconi liberi con capitale in gytheio sotto la protezione della lega achea nabide certo non contento della perdita del controllo diretto sulla maina ricostruì una flotta e rinforzò l esercito per muovere contro gytheio nel a c l esercito e la flotta della lega achea sotto il commando di filopemene provarono a liberare la città dall assedio ma furono sbaragliati appena fuori gytheio e costretti a ripiegare verso tegea lo stesso anno una flotta romana sotto il comando di atilius provò a riprendere gytheio nabide fu ucciso e sparta entrò a far parte della lega achea tuttavia gli spartani in cerca di un porto presero las gli altri stati membri della lega achea risposero assediando sparta e costringendola a mutare le proprie leggi età romana i manioti vissero in pace fin dal a c anno della battaglia di corinto il conflitto che si concluse con la distruzione di corinto da parte dell esercito romano comandato da lucio mummio acaico e con l annessione della lega achea da parte della repubblica romana anche se i romani conquistarono tutto il peloponneso alla comunità dei laconi liberi fu consentito di mantenere una relativa indipendenza in condizioni di forte autonomia locale successivamente i manioti subirono incursioni dei pirati cretesi e della cilicia che danneggiarono fra l altro il tempio di poseidone al tenaro capo matapan la regione fu liberate dai pirati a seguito delle campagne militari appositamente intraprese da pompeo il grande probabilmente per gratitudine i manioti fornirono a pompeo contingenti di arcieri nelle sue battaglie contro giulio cesare durante la guerra civile romana a c durante la guerra civile romana a c nella sua fase finale a c i manioti e i laconi assistettero ottaviano augusto fornendo truppe per la marina augusto sconfisse marco antonio e cleopatra vii nella battaglia di azio il settembre del a c e per gratitudine visitò psammathous e riconobbe ufficialmente l autonomia della comunità maniota che divenne una sorta di territorio semi indipendente era l inizio dell età d oro della maina la maina fiorì sotto i romani la comunità koinon consisteva di città poi delle quali gytheio rimaneva la più importante tuttavia altre parti della maina restavano sotto l altra unità territoriale semi indipendente di sparta in particolare i centri abitati di asine e kardamyli la maina tornò a essere un centro di rilievo per la fabbricazione della tintura di porpora che era molto richiesta a roma così come era anche nota per l estrazione di porfido rosso antico las passavas è ricordata come una importante città romana con bagni e ginnasio pausania il periegeta ci ha lasciato una descrizione della città di gytheio all epoca dell imperatore marco aurelio l agoprà l acropoli l isola di cranae marathonisi dove secondo la leggenda paride aveva celebrato le sue nozze dopo aver rapito a sparta elena prima di salpare definitivamente verso troia il migonium o recinto di afrodite migonitide e il colle larysium koumaro che si erge alle spalle dell abitato oggi i maggiori resti archeologici sono da ricondurre all età romana e sono stati in parte sommersi dal mare la comunità koinon rimase semi indipendente fino alle riforme territoriali di diocleziano nel con le invasioni barbariche la maina divenne un rifugio sicuro per i profughi di altre aree dell impero nel un forte terremoto devastò gytheio età tardoimperiale il gennaio teodosio i che per l ultima volta nella storia aveva riunito l impero romano sotto il suo controllo morì il figlio più grande arcadio gli succedette nel trono dell impero romano d oriente del quale la maina divenne definitivamente parte fra il e il alarico i e i suoi visigoti presero il peloponneso e distrussero ciò che rimaneva di gytheio alarico sottomise anche le città più importanti corinto argo e sparta fu alla fine sconfitto da stilicone e riattraversò il golfo di corinto verso nord nel gaiserico re dei vandali tentò di sottomettere la maina con lo scopo di farne una base per i raid e per la conquista di tutto il peloponneso la sua flotta provò a prendere terra a kenipoli ma gli stessi abitanti aggredirono i contingenti appena sbarcati e li costrinsero a ritirarsi con una prima dimostrazione storica della proverbiale fierezza dei manioti qualche decennio più tardi il famoso generale bizantino belisario sulla via per la sua vittoriosa campagna contro il regno dei vandali che avrebbe riconquistato restituendo all impero la provincia d africa si fermò a kenipoli per donare rifornimenti e onorare la vittoria dei kenipolitani fra i quali reclutò anche alcuni soldati secondo greenhalgh e eliopoulos nel gli avari scesi nella grecia meridionale con gli slavi invasero e occuparono gran parte del peloponneso occidentale tuttavia non vi sono riscontri archeologici della presenza slava o avara nel peloponneso prima della fine del vi secolo peraltro le tracce della presenza slava in grecia sono comunque molto rare età bizantina nella generale scarsezza di fonti dirette sulla maina spicca la vivida descrizione che ne fa costantino vii porfirogenito nel de administrando imperio sia noto che gli abitanti della maina non appartengono alla stirpe dei predetti slavi ma a quella dei più antichi romei che fino ai tempi presenti sono definiti elleni dai locali in considerazione del loro essere stati in tempi antichi idolatri e adoratori di idoli come gli antichi greci e che furono battezzati e divennero cristiani durante il regno del glorioso basilio il posto in cui vivono è privo di acqua e inaccessibile ma ha olivi dai quali essi traggono qualche consolazione nel brano appare per la prima volta il nome maina per la regione e da esso si apprende che i manioti furono cristianizzati definitivamente soltanto nel ix secolo tuttavia alcuni resti archeologici di chiese cristiane risalenti al iv secolo dimostrano che il cristianesimo vi era praticato già in tempi molto più antichi in ogni caso sembra di poter affermare che in base alle fonti disponibili i manioti sono stati gli ultimi abitanti della grecia a seguire apertamente la religione greca antica ciò può essere facilmente spiegato con la natura montagnosa della regione che rendeva i luoghi inaccessibili e adatti a ospitare coloro i quali tentavano di sfuggire alle cristianizzazioni forzose del v e del vi secolo la circostanza della lunga permanenza dei culti ellenici pagani tuttavia accresce la percezione dei manioti come eredi culturali diretti della tradizione greco spartana sotto il principato di acaia durante la quarta crociata i crociati presero e devastarono costantinopoli l impero bizantino si frantumò in diverse entità statali fondate dai vincitori latini e dai superstiti greci tra questi i più importanti erano despotato d epiro l impero latino di costantinopoli l impero di nicea e l impero di trebisonda che produssero imperatori o aspiranti tali in lizza fra loro per il controllo dell intera eredità bizantina compresi gli altri stati semi indipendenti in cui era stata divisa la restante parte del vecchio impero bizantino o che andavano emergendo nell area guglielmo di champlitte e goffedo i di villehardouin sconfissero i greci peloponnesiaci nella battaglia dell oliveto di koundouros e il peloponneso divenne il principato di acaia nel la maina fu infeudata al barone giovanni de neuilly come signore ereditario e costruì il castello di passavas sulle rovine dell antica las il castello occupava una posizione strategica controllando l importante passo fra gytheio e oitylo e conteneva le eventuali scorribande dei manioti i manioti tuttavia non erano facili da contenere e non erano neppure la sola minaccia per l occupazione franca del peloponneso i melengi una tribù slava da secoli stanziata sul taigeto minacciava la laconia da ovest e sulla costa est gli tsaconi ugualmente resistevano ai franchi nel guglielmo ii di villehardouin si mosse contro queste minacce egli usò l appena presa fortezza di monemvasia per controllare la tsaconia e costruì la città fortificata di mistrà alle falde del taygeto in posizione dominante sull antica sparta e sulla sua pianura per contenere i melengi per meglio contrastare le incursioni dei manioti costruì il castello si grand magne che probabilmente si può identificare nel fortilizio di tigani esso è descritto come un pauroso sperone roccioso un vescovo latino insediato nella maina negli anni del xiii secolo nel il vescovo fu catturato durante la battaglia di pelagonia dalle forze del rinnovato impero bizantino sotto la leadership di nicea sotto il despotato di morea il luglio i bizantini condotti da michele viii paleologo ripresero costantinopoli nel peloponneso guglielmo ii di villehardouin fu lasciato libero ma a condizione di consegnare le fortezze di grand magne mistrà gerontre e monemvasia nonché di consegnare ostaggi del rango di lady margaret baronessa di passavas con l uscita dei franchi dalla laconia i manioti vissero in pace sotto il despotate of morea unità locale del nuovo impero bizantino dal quale vennero nominati i despoti che governavano la provincia questa situazione di pace avrebbe avuto fine con i primi attacchi dei turchi ottomani al peloponneso sembra che la maina sia stata dominata in quegli anni dal clan dei nikliani rifugiatasi nella regione dalla città di nikli nel secondo periodo bizantino della maina si formarono quattro caste nella popolazione locale i nikliani i megalogenites gli achamnomeri e i fameyi i nikliani erano gli abitanti della città di nikli rifugiatisi nella maina dopo il saccheggio della loro dimora originaria per opera dell imperatore bizantino andronico ii paleologo kyriakos kassis sostiene che i nikliani fossero all inizio una famiglia mentre patrick leigh fermor li identifica più generalmente con gli abitanti di nykli i nikliani erano la potente aristocrazia che iniziò a costruire castelli e case torri nella maina i megalogenites cioè ben nati erano rifugiati da diverse parti della grecia provenienti da famiglie potenti e conosciute come le dinastie imperiali dei commeni e dei palaeologi ma anche dei latriani o medici ed altre perlopiù ignoravano le leggi tribali dei nikliani o provavano a vivere in armonia con esse anche i megalogenites costruivano case torri come i nikliani gli achamnormeri erano la classe media dei manioti dai diritti ridotti rispetto alle prime due classi essi potevano costruire case torri meno alte e di materiali meno nobili del marmo e della pietra erano comunque proprietari di terre e spettava loro una porzione dei beni comuni come la piccola cacciagione il sale e il pesce avevano libertà di movimento e mezzi di produzione secondo il costume locale una costruzione di torre riuscita durante la notte ne comportava la promozione sociale sempre che non fosse contrastata con successo dai vicini i fameyi erano l ultima casta non avevano proprietà ed erano forza lavoro non qualificata si possono paragonare ai servi della gleba dell europa occidentale potevano ottenere l emancipazione e diventare achamnormeri la conquista ottomana dopo la caduta di costantinopoli conquistata il maggio dal sultano ottomano maometto ii la maina rimase sotto il controllo del despotato di morea per alcuni anni fin quando nel mehmet occupò anche il peloponneso travolgendo le difese passive dell hexamilion la muraglia costruita dai bizantini di morea lungo l istmo di corinto negli anni intercorrenti fra la caduta di costantinopoli e la conquista ottomana del despotato di morea questo era stato governato dai due fratelli dell ultimo imperatore costantino xi demetrio paleologo e tommaso paleologo nel nessuno dei due seguì l esempio del fratello maggiore morto sugli spalti della città imperiale mentre difendeva le mura delle blacherne dagli assalti turchi tommaso fuggì in italia mentre demetrio si rifugiò addirittura presso lo stesso maometto ii cui diede in moglie la figlia avuta da theodora asanina elena paleologa krokodeilos kladas un famoso condottiero greco di laconia nel fu insignito da maometto ii della signoria di elos a varvounia in chiave difensiva rispetto alle scorrerie dei manioti kladas non fu un buon investimento per l impero ottomano e condusse fino alla morte una politica personale e anti ottomana destreggiandosi fra i poteri locali e venezia sempre più interessata allo scacchiere peloponnesiaco inoltre in quei primi anni di dominazione ottomana la popolazione della maina ebbe un tumultuoso aumento dovuto alle migliaia di rifugiati che vi confluivano da altre aree della grecia in cerca di relativa libertà dopo il nacquero nella maina nuovi insediamenti come skoutari fondata dai cittadini fuggiti da costantinopoli la popolazione dell area oggi di poco superiore ai abitanti salì all epoca fino a un numero imprecisato fra i e gli abitanti chateau reneau riferisce che all inizio del xvii secolo vi erano nella maina insediamenti urbani ma si pensa sia un esagerazione ancora nel nonostante la costante emigrazione il censimento ottomano per quanto sottostimato a causa della propensione dei manioti a sottrarsi ai controlli turchi registrò abitanti nel william martin leake riferisce che vi erano abitanti nella maina dodici anni più tardi k koumas scrive nel suo trattato di geografia che la maina ha abitanti ma il numero è ritenuto chiaramente frutto di esagerazione in uno scritto del fatto da anagnostras per la filiki eteria si dice che la maina ha uomini in armi kassis giunge alla conclusione che la popolazione totale in quegli anni si aggiri intorno alle unità nel kladas si unì ai veneziani nella guerra turco veneziana in quella veste condusse i manioti contro gli ottomani fino al quando la repubblica di venezia concluse la pace con gli ottomani e cedette all impero il brazzo di maina kladas rifiutò di accettare le condizioni della pace e si diede alla macchia con i più fedeli dei suoi i veneziani misero una taglia sulla sua testa dopo la fine della guerra turco veneziana molti dei greci che si erano schierati contro gli ottomani furono massacrati dai turchi ma altri si rifugiarono nella maina dove continuarono a resistere maometto ii inviò contro di loro fanti e cavalieri al comando di ale boumico i veneziani in cerca di buone relazioni con l impero ottomano non aiutarono i ribelli e anzi tennero un atteggiamento apertamente favorevole ai turchi gli ottomani raggiunsero oitylo prima di kladas e i manioti li attaccarono e li massacrarono sfuggirono alla morte soltanto in pochi fra i quali il comandante boumico kladas invase la piana di laconia con manioti e fece strage degli abitanti di etnia turca che vi si erano stanziati negli anni precedenti un mese più tardi una grande forza armata sotto il comando di ahmed bey invase la maina e catturò kladas che fu condotto a porto kagio qui egli fu prelevato da tre galee di re ferdinando i di napoli per ritardare i turchi abbastanza da consentire a kladas di fuggire la retroguardia maniota attaccò l esercito ottomano kladas riuscì a raggiungere il regno di napoli dove divenne un capo mercenario ritornò nella maina nel and fu ucciso in uno scontro nei pressi di monemvasia fra l impero ottomano e la repubblica di venezia fra il e il la maina mantenne la propria autonomia e non subì invasioni da parte degli ottomani questi infatti erano assorbiti dal tentativo di estromettere definitivamente i veneziani dal peloponneso vi riuscirono nel quando con la guerra turco veneziana conquistarono monemvasia e nauplia gli ottomani sotto selim ii si prepararono a invadere l isola veneziana di cipro e a tal fine costruirono una fortezza nella maina a porto kagio rinforzando anche passavas l idea era quella di tagliare le linee di comunicazione veneziane e al contempo di tenere sotto controllo i manioti questi ultimi allarmati chiesero l assistenza di venezia e la flotta veneziana con l aiuto dei guerrieri manioti conquistò la nuova fortezza cipro cadde pochi anni più tardi ma le flotte alleate della lega santa sconfissero la flotta ottomana nella battaglia di lepanto i greci credettero che don giovanni d austria avrebbe aiutato la loro rivolta al comando del vescovo di monemvasia ma il promesso contingente militare non arrivò e nel il vescovo dovette ripiegare nella maina i manioti si appellarono inutilmente al papa gregorio viii perché convincesse filippo ii di spagna ad assicurare supporto militare nel i manioti approcciarono papa clemente viii che aveva da poco preso la croce clemente morì due anni più tardi senza avere avuto il tempo di concretizzare un iniziativa nel senso richiesto dai manioti e questi iniziarono a cercare un nuovo campione identificandolo in filippo iii di spagna essi lo pressarono affinché prendesse terra con il suo esercito presso porto kagio e promisero di unirsi con ben uomini armati cui si sarebbero aggiunti altri peloponnesiaci i manioti mandarono anche inviati presso le maggiori potenze cristiane del mediterraneo come la repubblica di venezia il regno di francia la repubblica di genova il granducato di toscana e nuovamente la spagna tutti si dissero interessati e mandarono diverse spedizioni nella maina ma con l eccezione della spedizione spagnola che attaccò e saccheggiò passavas non fecero nulla di concreto i manioti trovarono infine un nuovo campione in carlo i gonzaga duca di mantova carlo discendeva per parte di nonna dall imperatore bizantino andronico i paleologo ed esattamente dalla linea di teodoro i del monferrato figlio di andronico mediante questa connessione carlo gonzaga rivendicava il trono di costantinopoli egli avviò contatti con i manioti che lo chiamavano re costantino paleologo quando ciò giunse all orecchio della sublime porta il governo ottomano inviò il generale arslan al comando di un armata di uomini e navi con l ordine di invadere la maina per la prima volta questa spedizione ottomana riuscì a distruggere e sottomettere la maina e conseguentemente a imporre un tributo ai manioti i quali si guardarono bene dal pagarlo in seguito carlo i alla notizia della scorreria si mosse attivamente per la sua crociata mandando inviati presso le principali corti europee in cerca di supporto nel reclutò sei navi e un contingente di mercenari ma fu costretto a desistere dai preparative a causa dell inizio della guerra dei trent anni l idea della crociata sbiadì e carlo gonzaga morì nel nel iniziò un nuovo conflitto turco veneziano la cosiddetta guerra di candia durante la quale la repubblica di venezia fu costretta a difendere creta provincia veneziana fin dal dai poderosi attacchi ottomani inizialmente condotti da ibrahim i i manioti appoggiarono i veneziani e offrirono loro navi nel l ammiraglio francesco morosini con manioti occupò kalamata già da allora la città di rilevanti dimensioni più vicina alla maina nel durante l assedio di candia alcune navi pirate maniote si infilarono in mezzo alla flotta ottomana e diedero a fuoco diverse grandi navi turche tuttavia candia cadde nel e creta divenne una provincia ottomana ancora una volta dopo l esito negative di rivolte e guerre contro l impero ottomano la maina accolse ondate di rifugiati greci provenienti da diverse aree inclusa l asia minore e specialmente da creta dopo il i profughi cretesi si stabilirono nella maina creando villaggi con nomi cretesi e arricchirono il dialetto locale con espressioni costrutti e fonemi tipici del dialetto cretese le migrazioni di massa verso la maina non mancarono peraltro di creare problemi la scarsità di suolo arabile condusse a molte guerre locali fra diverse famiglie clan e villaggi l era delle faide che avrebbe per più di due secoli caratterizzato l ethos maniota cominciò allora molti manioti invece cominciarono a servire come mercenari nelle armate del doge di venezia mentre altri divennero pirati sia per ragioni di sopravvivenza sia per meglio seguire i loro ideali patriottici catturata creta gli ottomani rivolsero le proprie attenzioni sulla maina il gran vizir k pr l faz l ahmet pasha inviò il corsaro hasan baba a sottomettere la penisola baba giunse nella maina e chiese agli abitanti di consegnare ostaggi ma ricevette proiettili non solo durante la notte dieci manioti tagliarono le gomene delle navi di baba mandandole a infrangersi contro gli scogli a questo punto i manioti attaccarono le navi e fecero strage dei turchi che erano a bordo baba riuscì a salvarsi per poco fuggendo con l unica nave superstite nelle prigioni di costantinopoli era recluso in quegli anni un famoso pirata maniota allora venticinquenne limberakis gerakaris all età di quindici anni egli aveva iniziato a servire su una galea veneziana come rematore successivamente si era dedicato alla pirateria ed era stato catturato dagli ottomani nel il gran visir decise di offrirgli un amnistia se avesse cooperate con il governo ottomano aiutandolo a riprendere stabilmente il controllo sulla maina gerakaris accettò la proposta e nel fu quindi nominato bey della maina uno dei suoi primi atti fu quello di esiliare i clan che erano tradizionalmente nemici della sua famiglia gli iatriani e i stephanopoulos entrambi di oitylo gli iatriani lasciarono la maina nel e si stabilirono a livorno dove presero il nome di medici che era una traduzione quasi letterale del loro cognome gli stephanopoulos furono forzati a lasciare oitylo nel e dopo averne ottenuto il permesso dalla repubblica di genova si stabilirono in corsica in un primo momento a paomia e successivamente a cargese dove si creò in tal modo una minoranza greca che fino a tempi recenti ha mantenuto la coscienza storica della propria provenienza tra il e il vi fu un esodo massiccio di manioti verso l europa occidentale negli anni del xvi secolo alcuni manioti emigrarono a volterra quanto al clan stephanopoulos ben persone che ne facevano parte emigrarono in corsica numerosi erano anche i latriani che in seguito latinizzarono il proprio nome in medici insediatisi a livorno grazie a una concessione di ferdinando de medici vi sono menzioni di manioti anche a napoli e tommaso asanis paleologo vi costruì una chiesa di rito greco vi sono anche tombe di paleologi in cornovaglia e inghilterra una in particolare nell abbazia di westminster di un paleologo che combatté con oliver cromwell carlo v re di spagna e imperatore del sacro romano impero aveva fra i suoi contingenti un corpo chiamato i manioti la diaspora maniota toccò l isola di sardegna stabilendosi sul salto di montresta sulla costa nord occidentale in provincia di oristano limberakis ben presto perdette i favori del governo ottomano e si unì alle attività piratesche dei suoi compatrioti fino a essere nuovamente catturato nel con gli ottomani occupati nella guerra contro l austria i veneziani videro un opportunità per riprendere i territori persi nel peloponneso e così diedero avvio a una nuova guerra il generale turco nel peloponneso ismael bey prevenne il piano attaccando la maina con soldati i turchi devastarono le campagne ma nottetempo i manioti attaccarono ferocemente e ne uccisero gli altri turchi si ritirarono uno dei castelli di kelefa e zarnatas che furono assediate dai manioti dopo un breve assedio questi riuscirono a prendere koroni e kelefa tuttavia ismael inviò altri fanti e artiglieri a porre a loro volta l assedio ai manioti asserragliati a kelefa quando i turchi erano vicini alla conquista giunsero veneziani comandati da francesco morosini e costrinsero gli ottomani a togliere l assedio e a ripiegare a kastania con i manioti all inseguimento i veneziani con l assistenza di contingenti greci conquistarono tutto il peloponneso e giunsero fino ad atene ponendola sotto assedio risale a questo momento storico la famosa esplosione del partenone che gli ottomani avevano adibito a deposito di munizioni quando i bombardamenti dei veneziani lo colpirono un ampia parte al centro dell edificio saltò in aria e i danni sono visibili anche dopo le successive anastilosi dei secoli seguenti gli ottomani alle strette liberarono per la seconda volta gerakarios limberakis e lo nominarono sua altezza il governatore della maina limberakis immediatamente lanciò diversi raid nel territorio veneziano ma ben presto in un clima di sospetti reciproci fra i quali un tentativo di avvelenamento forse di fonte ottomana liberakis ancora una voltà cambiò bandiera e passò dalla parte dei veneziani i veneziani lo insignirono del cavalierato di san marco e del titolo di signore di rumelia limberakis attaccò arta quando gli ottomani distrussero le sue mansioni a karpenisi prese e devastò la città prima di fare rientro nella maina gli artani protestarono ufficialmente presso il doge limberakis alla fine della guerra di morea mosse in italia dove sarebbe morto quattordici anni più tardi nel gli ottomani attaccarono il peloponneso per riaffermarvi il proprio dominio e riuscirono a cacciare i veneziani in soli settanta giorni di combattimenti la marina veneziana vinse alcune minori battaglie navali al largo della maina ma la guerra era ormai perduta l anno successivo il trattato di passarowitz sancì l abbandono veneziano delle pretese sul peloponneso la rivolta di orlov la rivolta orlov fu l evento storico precursore della guerra d indipendenza greca che vide i greci sollevarsi nel peloponneso sotto l incitamento del conte orlov comandante della flotta navale russa nella guerra russo turca in grecia essa è nota come eventi orlov in greco volendo indebolire l impero ottomano e stabilire uno stato greco filo russo nei balcani dopo un primo contatto in russia attraverso un greco ivi residente di nome papazolis emissari russi vennero inviati nella maina a metà degli anni del xviii secolo per stringere un patto con i dirigenti locali che rappresentavano il grosso della forza militare in grecia in quel momento nel durante la guerra russo turca una flotta di navi da guerra comandate dal conte aleksey grigoryevich orlov salpò dal mar baltico per il mediterraneo la flotta raggiunse mani nel febbraio per chiedere ai manioti di innalzare le loro bandiere di guerra soldati russi rimasero in appoggio ai greci per combattere nella guerra di terra mentre la flotta salpò per il mar egeo si decise di dividere l armata in due gruppi la legione occidentale e la legione orientale la prima sotto il comando di ioannes mavromichalis soprannominato o skilòs il cane dolgorougoph e komoundouros constava di manioti e dodici russi la seconda sotto il comando di barkof grigorakis e psaros consisteva di manioti e sei russi la flotta russa mise sotto assedio koroni con l assistenza da terra della legione occidentale l assedio si rivelò difficile e subito orlof entrò in disaccordo con mavromikalis il quale accusava il primo di insufficiente determinazione rilevando che senza una rapida occupazione di koroni non si sarebbe dovuta sollevare invano la popolazione greca orlov replicò definendo i manioti rabbiosi e rudi montanari secondo le fonti mavromichalis replicò in linea con il carattere maniota l ultimo di questi montanari rabbiosi difende la sua libertà con la propria spada e la protegge più di voi servo di una prostituta la legione orientale debellò un contingente di ben ottomani la sublime porta reagì inviando nel peloponneso un armata di soldati i quali prima di invadere il peloponneso saccheggiarono l attica a rizomylo in messenia furono però fermati da mavromichalis e armati i manioti li trattennero a lungo ma le forze ottomane infine prevalsero in forza della loro superiorità numerica catturarono infine lo stesso mavromichalis e lo torturarono a morte quindi invasero la maina e iniziarono a saccheggiarne le campagne durante la notte però un armata di manioti comprese diverse donne attaccò il campo nemico attendato nei pressi di almiro gli ottomani persero unità mentre gli aggressori subirono soltanto perdite l esercito greco ebbe quindi un buon successo iniziale liberando rapidamente ampie porzioni di morea la rivolta però non riuscì a diffondersi in modo efficace nel resto della grecia con la notevole eccezione di creta sotto la guida di ioannis vlahos noto come daskalogiannis con l assistenza degli isolani greci la flotta russa fu in grado di segnare una vittoria importante contro la marina turca nella battaglia di cesme ma questo non aiutò l esercito greco in morea quando i russi non riuscirono a portare le forze che avevano promesso la rivolta fu presto repressa subito dopo la spedizione di orlov diversi manioti entrarono nelle forze armate russe leader di questi volontari furono due esponenti di importanti clan manioti stephanos mavromichalis e dimitrios grigorakis arruolati con il grado di maggiore mavromichalis divenne il primo comandante nativo dell albanskoi voisko legione albanese una unità di rifugiati dell impero ottomano che furono stanziati in crimea e più tardi riogranizzati nel grecheskii pekhotnyi polk dal punto di vista russo la missione del conte orlov fu un successo danneggiando la flotta turca dirigendo le truppe turche a sud e contribuendo alla vittoria che portò alla firma del trattato di k k kaynarca dal punto di vista greco fu invece un fallimento che costò un enorme numero di vite umane sia in battaglia che nelle rappresaglie turche che seguirono i greci vennero del tutto dimenticati nel trattato di k k kaynarca e pertanto divennero sempre più diffidenti nei confronti dei russi mentre i rapporti greco russi rimasero forti in parte a causa dell influenza dei greci di primo piano in russia molti tra le nuove generazioni di capi greci come petrobey e kolokotronis guardavano ad occidente per nuove alleanze nella maina infine la rivolta orlov segnò l inizio della più decisa invasione mai attuata dall impero ottomano il fallimento della rivolta orlov fu un disastro per la maina i manioti furono ricacciati nella maina e furono costretti a pagare un tributo agli ottomani i quali imposero un bey locale che li governasse e mandarono truppe turco albanesi a presidiare la penisola il bey del peloponneso hatzi osman credette allora che fosse il momento storico buono per prendere una volta per tutte il controllo della maina e impressionare favorevolmente il sultano ottomano quando i manioti percepirono i preparativi ottomani raccolsero un contingente militare sotto la guida di éxarchos grigorakis e del nipote tzanetos grigorakis che provenivano dal potente clan di ayeranos dopo poco haci osman con uomini pose sotto assedio le case torri del clan a kastania i difensori erano konstatinos kolokotronis e panagiotes venetsanakis con soli uomini e donne in armi il combattimento durò dodici giorni e molti dei difensori furono uccisi gli altri furono fatti prigionieri torturati e uccisi per smembramento la moglie di konstantinos kolokotronis fuggì vestita come un guerriero maniota portando nascosto con sé il suo bambino theodoros kolokotronis il futuro eroe della guerra d indipendenza greca da kastania hasan ghazi avanzò verso skoutari e pose sotto assedio le torri del potente clan grigorakis nel frattempo il contingente maniota sotto il comando dei grigorakis composto da uomini e donne stabiliva una posizione difensiva sulla zona montuosa sopra il villaggio di parasyros l armata ottomana avanzò nella piana di agio pigada letteralmente ben fatta i turchi mandarono inviati ai manioti proponendo negoziati i manioti inviarono sei uomini hasan incontrati gli inviati greci chiese loro i bambini di dieci comandanti come ostaggi nonché tutte le armi maniote e una tassa capitale annuale in riparazione del torto di avere aiutato gli invasori russi i manioti risposero ad hasan secondo la tradizione preferiamo morire che dare le nostre armi e i nostri bambini non pagheremo tributi perché la nostra terra è povera hasan infuriato fece decapitare i sei inviati e ne fece impalare i corpi in vista dei manioti dopo l uccisione degli inviati i manioti attaccarono gli ottomani il combattimento fu fiero e soltanto turchi riuscirono a fuggire e a ritirarsi a mistrà allora capitale della laconia non si conosce il numero esatto delle perdite maniote ma quelle turche ammontarono a circa unità nel hasan ghazi tentò di indebolire il clan grigorakis ordendo l omicidio di exarchos lo invitò a tripoli allora capitale del peloponneso e lo trattò come un ospite onorato ma poi lo fece uccidere la successiva domenica di pasqua la madre di exarchos incitò gli uomini di skoutari alla vendetta comandati da zanetos gli uomini vestiti da preti ottennero il permesso di attraversare passavas una volta dentro gli scutarioti posero mano alle armi sterminarono la guarnigione turca e saccheggiarono il villaggio nel gli ottomani fermarono il bey della maina michalis troupakis lo misero su una nave e lo inviarono a mitilene dove fu condannato a morte per pirateria e ucciso la sublime porta nominò zanetos grigorakis al suo posto ma dovette catturarlo e forzarlo ad accettare la carica di fronte al netto rifiuto opposto da questi gli anni dei clefti durante il mandato di zanetos grigorakis la maina divenne la base preferenziale per molti clefti e aktri banditi greci fra essi vi erano il famoso pirata greco lambros katsonis che aveva aiutato i russi durante la rivolta orlov andreas androutsos padre del patriota greco odysseas androutsos e zacharias barbitsiotis il gennaio caterina ii di russia mandò il proprio rappresentante alexander bezborodko a siglare il trattato di jassy con il grand vizir ottomano koca yusuf pasha il trattato poneva fine alla guerra russo turca riconosceva l annessione russa della crimea e trasferiva alla russia yedisan facendo del dniester la frontiera russo turca in europa lambros katsonis disse aikaterini greek catherine ha fatto il suo trattato ma katsonis non ha fatto il suo con il nemico katsonis insieme ad androutsos e zacharias costruì una batteria di cannoni a porto kagio quindi mise insieme un piccolo contingente militare e una flottiglia di undici navi per attaccare le navi ottomane che transitavano in quell area tuttavia non riuscì a controllare gli equipaggi che presero ad attaccare anche navi di altri paesi colando a picco fra l altro due navi francesi una flotta ottomana di trenta navi e una moderna nave da battaglia francese attaccarono porto kagio gli uomini di katsonis si dispersero e lui stesso fuggì a odessa a bordo di una delle sue ultime navi nel napoleone bonaparte all epoca generale dell armata rivoluzionaria francese sotto gli ordini del direttorio inviò presso i manioti due esponenti della famiglia stephanopoulos da decenni stabilita a cargese in corsica al fine di convincerli ad attaccare gli ottomani dal peloponneso mentre egli li avrebbe attaccati dall egitto zacharias and zanetbey accolsero la proposta e napoleone mandò loro rifornimenti di armi quando i turchi lo scoprirono sostituirono zanetos nella carica di bey della maina con panagiotis koumoundoureas nel gli ottomani deposero koumoundourakis ritenuto incapace di sottomettere l ex bey zanetos grigorakis che ancora andava ricevendo armi dalla francia nel suo castello di cranae come nuovo bey della maina fu scelto antonio grigorakis cugino di zanetos tuttavia la flotta turca sotto il commando dell ammiraglio seremet non riuscì a prendere la roccaforte di zanetos e fu costretta a ritirarsi nel seremet attaccò zacharias nella sua fortezza sul taigeto e provò a ucciderlo senza successo nel gli ottomani sempre più preoccupati per l inaffidabilità dei manioti attaccarono antonbey a gytheio preso atto del fatto che il bey non dimostrava alcuna reale intenzione di contrastare il cugino zanetos il quale continuava ad attaccare i turchi ancora una volta gli ottomani dovettero ritirarsi tre anni dopo antonbey si dimise e la scelta della sublime porta cadde sul genero konstantis zervakos ma ai manioti la designazione non risultava gradita e pertanto essi deposero zervakos nello stesso anno i leader manioti convennero a gytheio ed elessero bey della maina theodoros zanerakos theodorobey nipote di zanetbey nel gli ottomani attaccarono nuovamente la maina e nuovamente furono ricacciati indietro theodorobey fu rimosso poco dopo e sostituito con petros mavromichalis or petrobey pierros grigorakos un figlio di zanetbey entrò nell esercito russo e fu nominato comandante di un contingente di uomini conosciuto come la legione spartana questa era a sua volta inquadrata nella legione dei fucilieri leggeri composta da rifugiati dalle terre greche molti veterani di queste formazioni militari vennero a contatto grazie all esperienza con i russi con l associazione segreta greca filiki eteria che animò la rivoluzione anti ottomana e accese la guerra d indipendenza greca fra essi vi erano elias chrisospathis che iniziò i manioti alla società segreta nonché lo stesso pierros grigorakis e i suoi fratelli giorgos e zanetakos la maina nella guerra d indipendenza greca petros mavromichalis era il nipote di ioannes il cane era il primo bey maniota proveniente dal mesa mani nel era stato approcciato da napoleone per unirsi alla guerra contro gli ottomani ma dopo il fallimento dell invasione dell egitto petros era entrato nell esercito francese e aveva combattuto nelle isole ionie si mormorava che fosse stato nominato bey perché lo zio non era stato ucciso bensì si era convertito all islam ed era divenuto un ufficiale dell armata ottomana invece nel mavromichalis si unì alla filiki eteria e ai preparativi per la grande rivolta greca che si andavano allestendo i manioti conosciuti per le loro qualità belliche furono i primi fra i greci a unirsi al movimento di liberazione la filiki eteria mandò i suoi rappresentanti perrevos e chrisospathis a organizzare i manioti il marzo manioti si riunirono presso la chiesa dei tassiarchi arcangeli di areopoli e dichiararono solennemente guerra contro l impero ottomano precedendo il resto della grecia di circa una settimana la loro bandiera era bianca con una croce blu al centro e attorno alla croce il motto vittoria o morte e con o sopra lo scudo allusivo all antico invito delle madri spartane ai figli che partivano per la guerra ai manioti si deve l avere scritto vittoria e non libertà come nell attuale motto nazionale greco con la motivazione che la libertà per la maina era già un fatto acquisito da secoli per il quale non era necessario combattere si trattava semmai di riconquistare il resto delle terre un tempo bizantine e quindi per loro greche il marzo un contingente di maniots sotto il commando di petros mavromichalis theodoros kolokotronis e papaflessas marciò su kalamata il marzo la città fu presa da kalamata mavromichalis scrisse lettere agli stati d europa informandoli di cosa stesse accadendo in grecia e firmandosi come comandante in capo delle forze spartane sempre a kalamata si tenne un assemblea chiamata senato messenico kolokotronis voleva attaccare tripoli e catturare subito la capitale ottomana del peloponneso mavromichalis invece voleva catturare prima le città più piccolo e quindi stringere tripoli in una morsa per conquistarla il senato approve l idea di mavromichalis e i manioti attaccarono in massa gli ottomani in messenia e in laconia kolokotronis convinto di avere ragione marciò autonomamente sull arcadia con manioti quando entrò nella regione la sua banda dovette affrontare un contingente turco di uomini e lo sconfisse il aprile poche centinaia di soldati manioti sotto il comando del figlio di mavromichalis kyriaoulis si riunirono al campo di kolokotronis fuori tripoli il settembre la capitale ottomana del peloponneso cadde il luglio kyriakoulis mavromichalis fu ucciso vicino alla fortezza souliota di kaiapha mahmud ii era seriamente preoccupato dallo svilupparsi degli eventi e si risolse nel a chiedere aiuto al khedivè d egitto ormai semi indipendente muhammad ali of egypt ali promise di aiutarlo in cambio delle isole di creta e cipro nonché della nomina a pashà del peloponneso per il figlio ibrahim pasha fu quest ultimo che accolte le richieste egiziane da parte del sultano ottomano prese il comando del contingente del khedivè in grecia nel frattempo i greci erano assorbiti in dissidi interni tali da sfociare in episodi di guerra civile kolokotronis fu arrestato il figlio panos ucciso e il nipote nikitaras costretto a fuggire ibrahim pasha prese terra con la sua flotta a modone e in breve tempo riuscì a riprendere il controllo di tutto il peloponneso eccetto nauplia e la maina quando gli egiziani provarono a prendere nauplia furono ricacciati indietro da dimitrios ypsilantis e konstantinos mavromichalis il fratello di petros ibrahim pasha mandò quindi propri inviati nella maina per chiedere ai manioti di arrendersi in cambio della rinuncia al saccheggio delle loro terre i manioti risposero dai pochi greci di maina e dagli altri greci che si trovano qui a ibrahim pasha abbiamo riveuto la vostra lettera nella quale per metterci paura voi dichiarate che se non ci arrenderemo ucciderete i manioti e saccheggerete la maina noi siamo qui ad aspettare voi e il vostro esercito noi gli abitanti della maina sottoscriviamo e vi aspettiamo arrabbiato per la risposta ibrahim a capo di un contingente di soldati attaccò la maina il giugno fu fermato davanti alle mura di almyro e vergas a difendere le mura erano manioti e rifugiati greci sotto il commando di ilias mavromichalis come ibrahim mosse la sua fanteria e la sua cavalleria contro le posizioni maniote ordinò contestualmente a due delle sue navi inclusa quella sulla quale si trovava egli stesso ad attaccare con l artiglieria di bordo le fortificazioni greche lungo la costa l armata egiziana attaccò le posizioni maniote otto volte e otto volte fu ricacciata indietro i combattimenti proseguirono per alcuni giorni fin quando gli egiziani di ritirarono alla notizia che kolokotronis stava giungendo alle loro spalle con uomini i manioti inseguirono gli egiziani verso kalamata prima di ritirarsi a vergas la battaglia non soltanto costò a ibrahim perdite ma compromise il suo piano di invadere la maina dal nord mentre ibrahim iniziava il suo attacco su vargas una sua flottiglia veniva inviata ad attaccare areopoli questo piano viene descritto da greenhalgh ed eliopoulos come eccellente perché avrebbe potuto consentire la presa di sorpresa della mal difesa piazzaforte e con la caduta di aeropolis si sarebbero interrotte le linee di comunicazione e controllo che conducevano a gytheio oltre a consentire agli egiziani di attaccare vargas e almyro alle spalle il giugno ibrahim mandò dunque la piccola flotta con soldati ad attraccare nella baia di diros nei pressi di areopoli l allarme fu dato immediatamente al primo sbarco di egiziani mediante suono di campane subito donne e anziani che lavoravano nei campi accorsero armati dei soli attrezzi agricoli e attaccarono furiosamente gli egiziani i quali non avendo previsto alcuna resistenza furono presi di sorpresa e forzati a ritirarsi in una posizione fortificata sulla spiaggia dove attendere aiuto dalle navi alla fine soldati manioti giunsero velocemente dalle altre città della maina e gli egiziani furono costretti a nuotare fino alle loro navi non solo ibrahim perse altri uomini ma i suoi progetti di sottomissione della maina furono ulteriormente danneggiati più tardi le donne di diro sarebbero state ricordate dalla storiografia ufficiale neogreca come le amazzoni di diro ibrahim infastidito dalle sconfitte di vergas e diro si concentrò sul peloponneso lasciando un poco di tregua alla maina il pasha mandò un armata di arabi ad avanzare sul taigeto minacciando così anche la maina orientale comandava il contingente arabo un rinnegato greco di vordonia certo bosinas a polytsaravo gli arabi furono fermati da theodoros stathakos asserragliato con il proprio clan nella torre di famiglia bosinas circondò la torre e intimò la resa a stathakos per risposta il capo maniota miro su di lui e lo uccise gli uomini di bosinas fecero immediatamente un fuoco concentrato d artiglieria sulla torre e la rasero al suolo gli egiziani quindi procedettero contro polytsaravos e la raggiunsero il agosto gli abitanti del villaggio spedirono donne e bambini a rifugiarsi sulle montagne e si dedicarono a rinforzare le fortificazioni la milizia cittadina fu rinforzata con altri manioti ed il contingente difensivo arrivò a ben uomini intanto gli assalitori avanzarono con molte difficoltà a causa del terreno roccioso e accidentato che circondava la piazzaforte come gli arabi furono sotto le mura i manioti corsero fuori dalle fortificazioni e attaccarono gli assalitori in campo aperto gli arabi si ritirarono dopo aver sofferto la perdita di uomini a fronte di sole perdite fra i manioti questa battaglia messa in ombra da altri scontri quantitativamente più rilevanti è però una delle azioni decisive della guerra di indipendenza greca perché con essa i manioti bloccarono definitivamente lo slancio offensivo dell armata di ibrahim pasha il resto del peloponneso la grecia centrale e le cicladi furono liberati successivamente grazie all intervento delle forze navali della francia al comando di henri de rigny del regno unito al comando di edward codrington e dell impero russo sotto il comando di login geiden che sconfissero gravemente la flotta di ibrahim nella battaglia di navarino repubblica e reggenza nel ioannis capodistrias divenne governatore della grecia capodistrias entrò in forte polemica con il clan mavromichalis perché i manioti si rifiutavano di pagare le tasse al nuovo governo capodistrias richiese che tzanis mavromichalis il fratello di petros andasse a nauplia la prima capitale della grecia a negoziare come tzanis giunse nella città fu arrestato e imprigionato capodistrias quindi inviò soldati nella maina e fece arrestare petros imputandolo per alto tradimento il fratello konstantinos il difensore di nauplia e il figlio di petros georgios mavromichalis furono anche posti agli arresti nella capitale il settembre capodistrias si recò ad attendere alle funzioni religiose nella chiesa di san spiridione vide kostantinos e gerogios che aspettavano a lato della porta principale del tempio passando vicino a loro si fermò brevemente ed entrò in chiesa dopo pochi passi all interno dell edificio kostantinos fece fuoco con un arma tenuta nascosta e lo colpì alla nuca mentre georgios lo attaccava al cuore capodistrias crollò nelle braccia dei suoi attendenti i quali fecero fuoco su konstantinos che intanto aveva preso a correre allontanandosi dalla chiesa raggiunto da diversi proiettili morì dopo pochi metri il suo corpo fu fatto a pezzi dalla folla inferocita che lo gettò poi a mare georgios fu catturato e la sua esecuzione avvenne nell isola di bourzi appena al largo di nauplia sotto gli occhi del padre petros nel ottone di wittelsbach un figlio di ludwig i di baviera e teresa di sassonia hildburghausen divenne re di grecia fino alla sua maggiore età fu affiancato da un consiglio di reggenza presieduto da josef ludwig von armansperg uno dei primi atti del consiglio fu di sottomettere i manioti ordinando ai clan la decapitazione delle torri atto di forte valenza simbolica e altrettanto grave lesività dei sentimenti locali al contempo furono ordinate le liberazioni di petros e tzanis mavromichalis dalla prigionia nella maina fu stanziato un nutrito contingente di bavaresi essi presero stanza in areopoli ma durante la prima notte i manioti li circondarono e ne catturarono molti costringedoli ad abbandonare la zona il maggio quattro compagnie di truppe bavaresi assistite da quattro unità d artiglieria da campo assediarono il villaggio di petrovouni dopo poco manioti provenienti dagli altri villaggi nelle vicinanze circondarono la cittadina e attaccarono i bavaresi massacrandoli più tardi quello stesso anno un armata di uomini sotto il commando del generale christian von schmaltz assistita da cinque squadroni di manioti lealisti pose nuovamente l assedio a petrovouni ma si ritirò a gytheio alla notizia dell arrivo di un contingente di circa manioti dalle montagne circostanti il consiglio di reggenza prese atto dell impossibilità di risolvere la questione maniota con la forza e inviò un diplomatico max feder a trattare l inclusione della maina in un sistema costituzionale stabile egli incontrò diverse famiglie di maggiorenti manioti offrendo loro posizioni all interno delle nuove istituzioni greche molti degli achamnomeri e diversi esponenti dei megalogenites si lasciarono convincere tuttavia non poche delle famiglie più antiche e i più poveri fra gli achamnomeri rifiutarono l offerta neghittosi verso ogni forma di riduzione della propria autonomia a kitta questa divisione intestina provocò spargimenti di sangue quando i sostenitori del re attaccarono gli altri manioti riuniti sotto il comando di giorgaros skylakakos feder piombò su kitta con i suoi nuovi alleati e fece saltare in aria skylakakos e i suoi con tutta la sua torre nella quale si erano asserragliati sotto il regno di grecia sotto il governo di ottone i entrato nella pienezza dei suoi poteri con il raggiungimento della maggiore età le faide nella maina non si placarono le cosiddette vendette in italiano nell uso originale continuarono fino al quando una vendetta particolarmente cruenta fu arrestata grazie allo sforzo dell esercito greco nel frattempo nel creta si era rivoltata contro gli ottomani i manioti che si ritenevano accomunati ai cretesi da un rapporto definito di cuginanza inviarono a creta diversi contingenti di volontari i rivoltosi riuscirono a costringere i turchi a ritirarsi entro una fortezza e cominciarono un duro assedio una flotta ottomano britannica riportò l ordine nell isola e costrinse i rivoltosi manioti a rientrare in patria nel una nuova rivolta scoppià a creta e manioti affluirono sull isola al commando di petropoulakos anche stavolta però i cretesi furono sconfitti e i manioti rientrarono nella loro penisola all inizio del xx secolo la grecia fu coinvolta nella cosiddetta lotta macedone un conflitto militare contro i rivoluzionari bulgari della macedonia e le forze ottomane ivi stanziate molti volontari manioti presero parte alle operazioni belliche si ricordano in particolare gli esponenti delle famiglie dritsakos koutsonikolakos kosteas georgopapadakos iliopiereas loukakos kyriakoulakos e kalantzakos i manioti presero parte anche alle successive guerre in cui fu coinvolta la grecia le guerre balcaniche la i guerra mondiale e la guerra greco turca la partecipazione dei contingenti manioti a questi conflitti sotto le insegne di re costantino i di grecia crearono forti sentimenti monarchici e lealisti per questo motivo molti manioti si mantennero fedeli a costantino durante lo scisma nazionale la maina durante la ii guerra mondiale durante la ii guerra mondiale i manioti contribuirono significativamente come accennato allo sforzo militare greco uno dei leader dell opposizione greca all invasione italiana fu il colonnello konstantinos davakis maniota davakis al commando del reggimento del pindo sconfisse la brigata julia nella battaglia del pindo ottobre novembre nonostante la superiorità d armamento degli italiani più tardi la royal navy britannica sconfisse la regia marina italiana nella battaglia di capo matapan marzo al largo del maniota capo tenaro durante l invasione tedesco italiana la grecia fu divisa in zone di occupazione italiane tedesche e bulgare subito la maina rivisse il ruolo storico di rifugio per i greci riottosi al dominio straniero la penisola maniota divenne una roccaforte del battaglione di sicurezza una formazione di estrema destra creata dal governo fantoccio di ioannes rallis favorita dal sentimento anticomunista dei manioti la germania e gli italiani lasciarono la grecia nel e subito divampò la guerra civile greca le armate dell elas e del dse combatterono per cinque anni contro i monarchici e i lealisti governativi che si riconoscevano nell esercito regolare la maina non si riprese per decenni dalle due guerre e molti giovani emigrarono verso atene o verso gli stati uniti d america e l australia soltanto negli ultimi decenni lo spopolamento della penisola si è interrotto e si assiste a un leggero aumento della popolazione nei centri geograficamente più favoriti grazie alla riscoperta turistica della penisola il dialetto maniota il dialetto greco della maina è caratterizzato dalla mancata rotacizzazione nella pronuncia di il greco antico and sono diventati i in pressoché tutte le varietà del greco moderno tuttavia un numero di aree inclusa la maina mantengono più una palatalizzazione velare altra caratteristica tipica è la caduta della s in finale di parola sia nel dialetto maniota sia nel derivante dialetto di cargese corsica e condivide caratteristiche del vocabolario della fonologia e della grammatica con il dialetto zaconico il mantenimento della pronuncia antica della è una caratteristica molto arcaica del dialetto maniota e dello zaconico che alcuni riconducono alla posizione di tali idiomi ai margini dell area arvaniticofona e che distingue infatti anche i dialetti di kimi egina megara e il vecchio ateniese lo zaconico in particolare è generalmente ritenuto il solo idioma greco moderno che non discende dall antica koinè una delle conclusioni più plausibili è che le sopra indicate oasi linguistiche in buona parte oggi estinte siano le rimanenze di un ampia area continua dove si parlava un dialetto greco più arcaico del greco bizantino derivato dalla koinè e che ha poi dato origine al greco moderno e che è stata interrotta dall afflusso degli arvaniti nel medioevo tutte le varietà di greco moderno presentano consonanti velari prima delle vocali frontali e della j una ben conosciuta caratteristica delle parlate meridionali è l estrema palatalizzazione e affricamento delle consonanti velari in queste posizioni per esempio k x diventano prima di i e j t d o t d ciò accade particolarmente nel cretese e nel cipriota ma anche nel dialetto maniota che presenta anche altre caratteristiche comuni con quello di creta esempi a sinistra dialetto maniota a destra greco moderno o frasi economia non esistono molte informazioni sull economia della maina sotto gli ottomani fino alle prime informazioni riferite dagli osservatori stranieri nel xvii e nel xviii secolo nella maina esterna vi erano ai tempi olivi in gran numero ma soltanto alla fine del xviii secolo nel mesa mani le esportazioni dalla maina esterna includevano anche legno di pino e trementina e un agente tannico noto come prinokoki un colorante naturale rosse porpora il versante nord occidentale del mesa mani era ricco in piante d

caduto vittima di una congiura di palazzo gettavano sinistri sospetti sulla sovrana ritenuta complice se non artefice principale del complotto ai danni del duca di calabria il novembre luigi partì alla volta dell italia e dopo aver ottenuto l appoggio politico e militare di molti principi italiani entrò a benevento ai primi del raccogliendo ovunque l acclamazione dei baroni napoletani il gennaio la regina giovanna si diede alla fuga e lasciata napoli in nave si diresse in provenza dove poco dopo l avrebbe raggiunta il secondo marito luigi di taranto stabilito senza troppe difficoltà il proprio controllo sul regno luigi fu improvvisamente costretto alla ritirata dall arrivo della peste nera nell abbandonare in fretta e furia la capitale il sovrano lasciò la reggenza del reame napoletano nelle mani di due funzionari ungheresi contro di essi si sarebbe presto scatenato il malcontento dei baroni e del popolo che avrebbe aperto a giovanna e luigi di taranto la via del ritorno sul trono seconda spedizione contro napoli due anni dopo luigi tornò alla riconquista del meridione d italia con una seconda spedizione contro giovanna sempre sospettata di essere la responsabile della morte di suo fratello andrea raggiunta manfredonia via mare ai primi del luigi fu in breve tempo alle porte di napoli ma la stanchezza delle sue truppe stremate che chiedevano con forza la fine delle ostilità costrinse il re a rinunciare alla conquista del trono napoletano prima di lasciare l italia luigi ottenne l istituzione presso la corte papale di avignone di un processo a carico di giovanna per accertare le sue responsabilità nell assassinio di andrea il papa innocenzo vi in cambio cercò di coinvolgere luigi nella crociata contro i forlivesi appena bandita per stroncare l ultima resistenza ghibellina alla restaurazione del potere pontificio in italia il processo riconobbe l innocenza della regina giovanna che poté opportunamente barattare la sentenza di assoluzione con la cessione alla chiesa del dominio della città di avignone in tal modo le rivendicazioni di luigi il grande furono definitivamente archiviate la conquista della dalmazia dal al fu impegnato in una nuova guerra contro venezia per il dominio sulla dalmazia dopo essere riuscito a costituire una lega anti veneta luigi mise a ferro e fuoco le città dalmate fino a strapparle ai veneziani il trionfo del sovrano fu sancito dal trattato di zara del con cui gli veniva riconosciuto il comando della regione adriatica re di polonia il novembre morì casimiro iii di polonia pochi giorni dopo il novembre luigi fu incoronato re di polonia ma lasciò rapidamente l esercizio concreto del potere a sua madre elisabetta di polonia matrimoni e figli il agosto luigi contrasse il suo primo matrimonio con margherita di boemia figlia minorenne dell imperatore carlo iv e di bianca di valois l unione fu estremamente breve poiché la sposa morì ancor prima di raggiungere la maggiore età per luigi fu subito tempo di prendere nuovamente moglie e la scelta cadde su elisabetta kotromanic figlia di stefano ii di bosnia e di elisabetta di cuiavia le nozze si celebrarono a cracovia il giugno dal secondo matrimonio luigi ebbe tre figlie caterina maria regina d ungheria dal sposa di sigismondo di lussemburgo all epoca margravio di brandeburgo edvige regina di polonia dal sposa di ladislao ii jagellone morto nel granduca di lituania l eredità di luigi il grande quando luigi morì il settembre il trono d ungheria fu ereditato dalla figlia maggiore maria ma la grande nobiltà polacca non era disposta ad avallare ulteriormente l unione personale con l ungheria né ad accettare sigismondo consorte di maria come proprio reggente la scelta cadde allora sulla sorella minore di maria edvige che fu riconosciuta come nuova sovrana le trattative per l assunzione della corona polacca da parte di edvige furono gestite in sua vece dalla regina madre elisabetta vedova di luigi e reggente d ungheria dopo due anni di negoziati edvige si recò finalmente a cracovia dove il novembre fu incoronata re sic di polonia l uso del titolo al maschile aveva lo scopo di sottolineare il fatto che edvige

pecorini d europa sono esportati ed apprezzati in molti mercati soprattutto in nord america il prodotto è talvolta soggetto a pirateria alimentare e alcuni formaggi specialmente nelle americhe vengono surrettiziamente venduti con il nome di sardo cheese ma a volte sono formaggi che non hanno mai visto l isola cenni storici sin da tempi remoti la sardegna è stata terra di pastorizia i sardi nuragici erano oltre che guerrieri allevatori e di conseguenza produttori di formaggi in epoca romana poi i formaggi sardi arricchivano le tavole dei senatori e dei patrizi romani durante il periodo dei quattro regni dall isola ne venivano esportate diverse varietà tra le quali il sardesco il formaggio di torres il formaggio bianco di arborea il formaggio di gallura sul mercato di genova i dazi per l importazione del formaggio di torres era di tre soldi e mezzo superiore a quella del formaggio paramensis ossia di parma altrettanto conosciuti ed apprezzati lo furono in epoca sabauda dove le casse reali riscuotevano cospicue somme provenienti dalle gabelle pagate dai commercianti che esportavano formaggi verso marsiglia napoli livorno genova nella seconda metà dell ottocento iniziarono le esportazioni verso il mercato americano del pecorino romano oramai prodotto direttamente in sardegna comportando la crescita del numero degli ovini che passarono da circa capi del a oltre milioni di capi nel pecora di razza sarda i formaggi ovini sardi sono ottenuti dal latte di una razza autoctona di pecora le cui origini sono antichissime la razza sarda è allevata in modo estensivo oltre che in sardegna anche in diverse regioni della penisola tra le quali il lazio la toscana l umbria le marche una delle sue principali caratteristiche e quella di avere una elevata produzione di latte che può arrivare fino a litri all anno nonostante sia ad attitudine lattifera la sua carne è molto richiesta e apprezzata sul mercato soprattutto l agnello tra gli e i kg di peso marginale è invece la produzione della lana che risulta di qualità grossolana adatta per tappeti e materassi il solo utilizzo di latte di pecora di razza sarda è tassativamente prescritto per la produzione del fiore sardo

alcuni allevatori per poter produrre questo prodotto legalmente e con le adeguate garanzie igieniche hanno incaricato l istituto di entomologia agraria di sassari di realizzare un allevamento di

chiostro dove ha sede la mensa studenti dell università di firenze storia il monastero delle camaldolesi di sant apollonia fu fondato nel da piero di ser mino una bitatnte del popolo di san simone così com è scritto nell atto di fondazione presso l archivio di stato di firenze tra il ed il furono annessi al monastero anche l abbazia di santa maria a mantignano e l ospedale di san pietro a porta pinti nell occasione la badessa cecilia donati chiese l autorizzazione a papa eugenio iv per eseguire lavori di ammodernamento e ingrandimento della struttura vennero allora ampliati il chiostro ed il cenacolo un ampia sala rettangolare con soffitto a cassettoni e una serie di finestre sulla parete destra affrescato su un intera parete da andrea del castagno nel a causa della clausura delle monache il cenacolo fu completamente ignorato dalle fonti antiche infatti né vasari né bocchi cinelli né il richa ne parlano nelle loro opere su firenze solo dopo la soppressione del se ne scoprirono i tesori nel fu ripristinato all uso monastico e nel fu in gran parte utilizzato ad uso militare con riduzione degli spazi destinati alle monache che furono nell occasione riconfigurati su progetto dell architetto gaetano baccani l anno successivo l occupazione si estese a comprendere anche la chiesa ai sensi della legge di esproprio per causa di pubblica utilità nel ne fu dichiarata la proprietà demaniale e sia per periodo che vide firenze capitale sia per i decenni successivi fu utilizzato per accogliere magazzini laboratori e uffici della direzione dei magazzini dell amministrazione militare previ lavori alla struttura diretti dal tenente colonnello giovanni castellazzi una parte del convento infatti fu demolita per l apertura di via xxvii aprile il complesso appare nell elenco

studi di firenze che a sua volta gli ha affittati in parte alla toscana film commission in via san gallo resta l antico accesso alla chiesa del monastero oggi sconsacrata e utilizzata come sala per conferenze tradizionalmente ricondotta a un disegno di michelangelo anche perché in questo monastero visse una sua nipote sebbene molto studiata questa ipotesi è oggi tramontata in via per lo più definitiva attribuendo il disegno a giovanni antonio dosio federico fantozzi segnalava la mostra del portale per essere stata assai male restaurata facendo evidentemente riferimento a un intervento condotto sul manufatto da parte dell architetto leopoldo pasqui visto che in alcune carte d archivio relative alla sua attività si ricorda la restaurazione della porta di michelangelo della chiesa di santa apollonia che era in pieno stato di deperimento l ex chiesa è ad aula unica con un colonnato che regge il coro delle monache sul soffitto ligneo intagliato e dorato campeggia un grande stemma del monastero con la tenaglia fu probabilmente disegnato dallo stesso dosio il presbiterio ha un abside quadrangolare dove si aprono nella parte superiore altre grate per le monache e presenta affreschi di bernardino poccetti tra i quali spicca la cupoletta con una visione paradisiaca allo stesso artista si deve anche un ultima cena nel comunicatorio delle monache completata ai lati da due lunette di fabrizio boschi il grande chiostro detto della badessa iniziato nel a due piani con su tre lati un colonnato di ordine ionico e colonnine al piano superiore dal in restauro qui si trovava una lunetta di andrea del castagno con il cristo in pietà sorretto da due angeli oggi esposta nel museo del cenacolo l unica lunetta affrescata ancora in loco è opera di vincenzo meucci un secondo

it,fulcanelli è lo pseudonimo di un autore di libri di alchimia del xx secolo la cui identità non è mai stata accertata lo pseudonimo utilizzato è formato dall unione delle parole vulcano ed helio due elementi che rimandano ai fuochi alchemici si è supposto potesse trattarsi di jean julien champagne o rené adolphe schwaller de lubicz o camille flammarion o pierre dujol o jules violle medico francese eugène canseliet nato nel si è sempre dichiarato discepolo di fulcanelli che parlò sempre attraverso canseliet che a sua volta curò le prefazioni dei suoi libri notizie fulcanelli scrisse il mistero delle cattedrali nel e le dimore filosofali nel che trattano dei simboli alchemici presenti nelle architetture delle antiche cattedrali gotiche per quanto riguarda il primo volume e di quelle di altre costruzioni nel secondo canseliet afferma che fulcanelli scrisse anche un terzo libro finis gloriae mundi che fu consegnato al canseliet per la pubblicazione ma poi ritirato in un secondo tempo il titolo di quest ultimo libro fa riferimento ad un dipinto di juan de valdés leal conservato presso la chiesa della santa caridad a siviglia e denominato proprio finis gloriae mundi due sono le versioni di questo misterioso trattato comunque affatto incompatibili e di dubbia provenienza una apparve già nel sulla tourbe des philosophes e l altra affidata a jacques d ares via internet l edizione italiana de finis gloriae mundi tradotta dal saggista moreno neri con il contributo di v b riporta nella prefazione il testo originale dell email ricevuta da jacques d ares indicando le motivazioni che hanno portato l ignoto autore alla scelta del destinatario altresì la traduzione in italiano è molto accurata ed in alcuni casi è considerata più esplicativa del testo originale in francese indubbiamente fondendosi senza soluzione di continuità ai primi due volumi il filo conduttore alchemico de finis gloriae mundi è la cosiddetta via breve ars brevis e più volte vengono riprese nozioni alchemiche già trattate precedentemente ne il mistero delle cattedrali o le dimore filosofali in merito alla ars longa gli studiosi di alchimia sono comunque concordi nell affermare che non sia possibile accertare la provenienza di finis gloriae mundi prima di aver accertato chi sia l autore o gli autori che si celano dietro lo pseudonimo di fulcanelli filosofo perché amante della saggezza e quindi istruito delle segrete operazioni della natura ne imitò i procedimenti va detto che il nome di filosofo in passato veniva dato a coloro che erano veramente istruiti dei procedimenti della grande opera si veda antoine joseph pernety dictionnaire mytho ermetique parigi la vostra preoccupazione sia quella di capire la pietra dei filosofi e nel contempo otterrete il fondamento della vostra salute il deposito delle ricchezze la nozione della vera sapienza naturale e la conoscenza certa della natura traduzione di paolo lucarelli da lux obnubilata suaptè natura refulgens cera de lapide ophiklosophico theorica metro italico descripta et ab auctore innominato commenti gratia ampliata venetiis mdclxvi apud alexandrum zatta superiorum permissu privil proemium le opere di fulcanelli furono considerate straordinarie perché quale alchimista operativo nel senso più antico del termine ricostruiva partendo dal simbolismo ermetico i punti principali della grande opera illustrandone i principi teorici e la prassi sperimentale con un dettaglio e una precisione mai visti prima paolo lucarelli in la tradizione alchemica del xx secolo zenit studi quel che lucarelli vuol dire è che l enorme importanza di fulcanelli quale alchimista del xx secolo è il suo ritorno all antica maniera di praticare l alchimia sia nello stile che nella vita pratica fulcanelli al contrario degli alchimisti succedutisi a partire dal seicento che considerarono largamente e in qualche caso esclusivamente la branca spirituale alchemica recuperò e rinobilitò il lavoro manuale in laboratorio visto come procedimento fondamentale per considerarsi un seguace della grande opera la fama di fulcanelli ha raggiunto ogni continente e i suoi libri sono stati venduti in milioni di copie sicuramente l alone di mistero che avvolge questa figura del secolo scorso ha contribuito a fomentare l interesse verso il filosofo le ipotesi più accreditate vedono i due collaboratori il pittore champagne e il discepolo canseliet dietro l identità dell alchimista ma entrambi hanno sempre negato con fermezza un altra versione vede canseliet come ladro degli appunti del contemporaneo schwaller de lubicz riorganizzati e pubblicati sotto falso nome entrambe le versioni sono in realtà improbabili secondo lo studioso d alchimia cortesi il quale non vede in queste tre figure la stessa conoscenza e lo stesso stile riscontrabili nelle opere del fulcanelli e che non possono essere quindi scopiazzature del lavoro di de lubicz o opera di un giovane iniziato come canseliet un improbabile ipotesi vede nell identità fulcanelli il famoso alchimista rinascimentale nicolas flamel il quale dopo aver dedicato anni di studi sull elisir di lunga vita si crede sia giunto alla conclusione ed ora arrivato fino al secolo scorso con il nome appunto di fulcanelli citazioni di fulcanelli nella cultura e nella letteratura contemporanea c è una canzone di frank zappa intitolata but who was fulcanelli nel

it,lìmena imena in veneto è un comune italiano di abitanti della provincia di padova in veneto situato a nord del capoluogo a limena dal fiume brenta si stacca il canale brentella evolutasi soprattutto nel secondo dopoguerra da paese ad eminente vocazione agricola a centro di produzione prevalentemente industriale la località mostra urbanisticamente parlando una ricca presenza di uno sviluppo industriale per decenni è stata afflitta da un traffico specialmente di veicoli industriali letteralmente asfissiante causato dall inesistenza di un collegamento autostradale diretto tra padova e l asse trento bolzano ragione che tuttora obbliga a servirsi dell ex statale valsugana oggi però la situazione è nettamente migliorata grazie all apertura nel di una nuova tangenziale che esclude l attraversamento dell abitato da parte dei tir di conseguenza limena sta vivendo una sorta di rinascita che la sta conducendo sempre di più sul terreno del settore terziario sia per quanto riguarda le attività di produzione di ricchezza più tipiche quasi tutti i concessionari di automobili patavini si sono trasferiti a limena solo per fare un esempio sia pure per quanto attiene al comparto dell intrattenimento ospita un cinema multisala fra i maggiori d italia e dell accoglienza turistica in senso ampio apertura nelle immediate adiacenze di hotel muniti di ampie e moderne sale congressi la drastica attenuazione della morsa del traffico e la conseguente riduzione del tasso di inquinamento i progetti di varie opere che miglioreranno la qualità della vita come nuovi parchi e piazze oltre alla costruzione di nuove case e nuovi quartieri entro i confini comunali e l esigua distanza intercorrente con il capoluogo di provincia limena infatti è uno dei primi comuni che si incontrano uscendo da padova potrebbero indurre un numero sempre maggiore di individui o famiglie a stabilirsi nel comune origini del nome il toponimo riflette verosimilmente il latino limen iminis ma osserva olivieri pg riesce difficile stabilire quale significato abbia limen nel caso specifico forse come geonimo per soglia di terreno sporgente dalle paludi qualora non indichi invece il confine tra padova e l antico contado vicentino che si estendeva già fin quasi alle mura di padova oppure il confine ovest della centuriazione di camposampiero non è neppure da escludere un origine greca del nome per assonanza col lemma greco antico limèn porto rifugio asilo il toponimo comunque è attestato già nell anno come villa que dicitur limena storia preistoria e mito come normalmente accade tanto da divenire quasi un affermazione tautologica per l epoca primordiale possiamo sostanzialmente azzardare poco più che semplici congetture per quel che riguarda limena l ordinaria difficoltà che affligge gli studi paleologici è inasprita dalle devastazioni arrecate al suolo dalle frequenti variazioni di corso e o di alveo del fiume brenta ovviamente più frequenti in un era in cui le opere di difesa idraulica non erano neppure concepibili talché la natura si manifestava a proprio temibile e totale arbitrio non è congettura però il ritrovamento di reperti archeologici nella zona di ponterotto contigua a limena su cui si fonda l ipotesi di antropizzazione a partire quanto meno dal neolitico età antica per l epoca romana vi è invece ricca documentazione storico scientifica dal ritrovamento di tombe romane nella zona paesaggisticamente gradevole del tavello alla mera constatazione del fatto che ben tre strade romane via dell arzere via di val medoaci via aurelia solcassero le terre di cui discorriamo un indiretta conferma dell importanza di limena già in epoca piuttosto remota può ravvisarsi nella qualifica di pieve riconosciutale dall imperatore berengario in un documento del aprile medioevo caduto l impero romano anche limena fu soggetta all imperversare di vari barbari e subì sostanzialmente le medesime vicissitudini del capoluogo provinciale cui rimandiamo per brevità ricorderemo tuttavia il ridimensionamento del territorio limenese occorso intorno al vii secolo con distacco della pieve di limena assegnata a vicenza fino al anno in cui il papa adriano iv ne disporrà il reintegro sotto la diocesi di padova nella cosiddetta età comunale limena ricadde com era prevedibile nella sfera d influenza patavina è a quest epoca di rinascita amministrativa e civile ma anche di conflitti campanilistici che risale lo scavo del già ricordato canale brentella di importanza strategica in quanto consentiva collegando il fiume brenta con l omologo bacchiglione di porre rimedio ai tagli che i vicentini operavano a monte sul bacchiglione allo scopo di privare i padovani della forza motrice per la panificazione la rilevanza tattica del contesto geografico de quo trova riscontro nell edificazione di un apposito castello a presidio del comprensorio brenta brentella l opera fu testimone ed ovviamente anche protagonista di svariate battaglie finché le truppe imperiali di massimiliano non la distrussero definitivamente nella cornice della guerra della lega di cambrai la serenissima dal i territori già soggetti a padova passarono sotto il dominio della repubblica di venezia venendone a costituire il dogado da tera età moderna e contemporanea non ripeteremo qui le note vicende del trattato di campoformio del risorgimento nazionale fino al plebiscito che riporterà nel buona parte del veneto limena compresa sotto le bandiere del regno d italia anche nella prima guerra mondiale limena fu accomunata alle vicende del resto dell italia della seconda guerra mondiale merita ricordare che limena per la sua incipiente rilevanza industriale e ferroviaria subì nel intensi bombardamenti per opera dell aviazione alleata come anticipato in apertura gli

la versione in lingua basca donostia tanto che il toponimo formale ed ufficiale della città è donostia san sebasti n ovvero con tutte e due le versioni e quella basca in precedenza il significato va ricercato nel termine originario e più antico donostia probabilmente una contrazione di done sebastian done in basco significa santo traducibile pertanto in lingua italiana come san sebastiano la versione castigliana risulta essere la semplice traduzione araldica civica lo stemma di donostia san sebasti n è uno scudo d azzurro alla nave d oro equipaggiata e banderuolata d argento fluttuante sopra un mare fluottuoso caricato dalle iniziali in castigliano della città s s lo scudo è contenuto in una bordura d argento recante l iscrizione in lettere maiuscole ganadas por fidelidad nobleza y

al dove si parla del monastero di san sebasti n nel il re di navarra sancho il saggio concede a donostia lo status di fuero questa mossa probabilmente dettata dalla volontà del re di garantirsi uno sbocco al mare per il suo regno si può considerare come la data ufficiale di fondazione della città nel la città passò sotto il controllo del regno di castiglia a seguito della conquista militare che ne permise un rapido sviluppo grazie alla pesca ai commerci marittimi e alla sua posizione strategica vicina alla francia e sul cammino di santiago di compostela a causa della guerra dei cent anni e dell avvicinamento del regno di navarra alla francia per motivi dinastici si ebbe lo spostamento del baricentro economico della regione e dei traffici commerciali verso bilbao causando una recessione economica alla città che decadde ulteriormente per un incendio nel che distrusse l intera agglomerato urbano verso la fine del xv secolo il regno di castiglia per compensare la perdita economica della

nel durante la la guerra di indipendenza spagnola la città tornò sotto il controllo francese per mano delle truppe napoleoniche verrà liberata solo nel dalle forze anglo portoghesi che dopo alcuni mesi d assedio entrarono in città attraverso una breccia nelle mura cittadine le truppe francesi si ritorarono nel castillo de la mota capitolando l settembre l assedio provocherà un incendio che porterà alla distruzione quasi completa della città nel la spagna definisce ufficilamente la città capoluogo della provincia di guipúzcoa e nel viene avviato il processo di ammodernamento della città che prevede l abbattimento delle mura cittadine e l espansione dell agglomerato urbano secondo il piano proposto da antonio cortazàr che permisero a san sebastian a riprendersi dall assedio del e a

it,caggiano è un comune italiano di abitanti della provincia di salerno in campania geografia fisica il paese è collocato su un rilievo dell appennino lucano al confine del parco nazionale del cilento e vallo di diano è il secondo comune più alto della provincia di salerno il primo è montesano sulla marcellana in direzione sud ovest ha di fronte la catena dei monti alburni al di là della quale si trova il mare di paestum ed il golfo di salerno secondo un racconto mitologico i monti alburni nella parlata locale li culuònn sono sede dei titani che qui si sarebbero rifugiati dal mar tirreno per sfuggire all ira di nettuno secondo una leggenda locale ad ogni terremoto i titani si spostano verso est proprio nella direzione del paese il settore meridionale del comune è caratterizzato da una topografia prevalentemente montana con una quota media sul livello del mare al di sopra dei metri il territorio montano di caggiano tuttavia non presenta forme del rilievo accidentate ma è strutturato a formare un altopiano dolcemente ondulato intervallato di tanto in tanto da versanti ripidi e scoscesi specialmente in corrispondenza dei pojie carsici come ai piedi della tempa del vento qui sono localizzate le cime più elevate del territorio monte sierio m slm monte moschiglione m slm pietra dei monaci m slm fosse di salinas m slm tempa del vento m slm monte sarcone m slm a nord ovest dell

pcm del classificazione climatica zona d gg origini del nome il toponimo caianus si originò come quello di altri paesi vicini quali colliano da lucullus sicignano da sicinius ricigliano da ricilius romagnano da romanius balvano da balbius ecc dal comunissimo praenomen caius portato da qualche patrizio romano che ne dovette possedere il fundus nella lingua latina l aggiunta del suffisso anus alla radice del nome proprio denota appunto appartenenza da tale praenomen deriva infatti anche il nome di un altro fundus caianus nell attuale provincia di roma e più precisamente nel comune di labico di cui ci è pervenuta notizia dal cosiddetto elenco costantiniano e quello infine del comune di caianello in provincia di napoli sappiamo ancora a riprova di quanto detto che l aggettivo caianus era assai in voga al tempo di caligola egli siccome in via ordinaria era chiamato col prenome caius tale aggettivo venne a indicare tutto ciò che si riferiva all imperatore tanto che i suoi sostenitori erano detti appunto caiani stesso nome fu successivamente dato da tertulliano ai seguaci della montanista quintilla che egli però confuse con un altra quintilla seguace appunto dello gnostico caius storia origini nel territorio sono stati rinvenuti resti preistorici in particolare nelle grotte dello zachito ai piedi del monte sulla cui cima si trova oggi il paese luogo particolarmente favorevole per la vicinanza del fiume melandro nell viii vii secolo a c l area entrò probabilmente in contatto con le colonie greche sulla costa il territorio doveva essere abitato da popolazioni di stirpe sabellica le vallate erano percorse da genti nomadi dedite alla pastorizia armate di frecce di pietra ed archi e con scudi di vimini mentre sulle alture sorgevano villaggi protetti da mura senza particolari prove la contrada di veteranuso a causa del suo nome è stata ritenuta il sito di un antica città ursentum o urseo capitale del popolo degli ursentini che sarebbe sorta nella località di tempa dei tiesti dove alcuni ruderi furono interpretati come resti di un centro abitato epoca romana il territorio entrò a far parte dei domini romani dopo le tre guerre sannitiche a c durante la seconda guerra punica annibale vi tese un agguato al console romano marco claudio marcello e non lontano spartaco fu definitivamente sconfitto presso dianum l antico centro da cui prende il nome il vallo di diano sotto il dominio dei romani il territorio faceva parte dell ager volceianus territorio della città di volcei attuale buccino e i suoi abitanti fecero parte della tribus pomptina sono attestate numerose epigrafi e la famiglia degli instei costruì una tomba monumentale nella località san stasio con la riorganizzazione dioclezianea il territorio di caggiano fece parte della nuova regio iii lucania et bruttii provincia della lucania e del bruzio epoca alto medioevale durante il periodo delle invasioni barbariche il territorio fu percorso da vandali e visigoti e fu interessato nel vi secolo dalle guerre tra goti e bizantini il territorio passò quindi sotto il dominio dei longobardi a cui si deve probabilmente un rafforzamento delle fortificazioni databile tra l viii e il ix secolo da alcuni importanti centri sulla costa rimasti in potere dei bizantini si rifugiarono verso l interno preti e monaci per lo più di rito greco perseguitati dagli iconoclasti con l indebolimento dei longobardi nel x xi secolo si ebbe una nuova espansione bizantina verso l interno e questo rinnovato legame con il mondo greco è testimoniato a caggiano dall edificazione di chiese di rito greco come santa caterina e santa maria dei greci nell xi secolo l italia meridionale venne conquistata dai normanni guidati da roberto il guiscardo a caggiano il loro arrivo intorno al fu segnato dal rafforzamento delle fortificazioni preesistenti e dalla costruzione di un castello sul sito di precedenti opere fortificate il luogo aveva infatti notevole importanza a controllo delle vie verso la calabria e la puglia percorse dai pellegrini diretti in terra santa intorno al castello si sviluppò quindi un piccolo borgo primo nucleo dell attuale abitato con alcune dimore ed altri edifici che ben presto ottenne il titolo di università feudale nel xii secolo i templari vi eressero una mansio in contrada sant agata mentre l ordine degli ospitalieri il futuro ordine di malta gestiva l ospedale dedicato a san giovanni con la soppressione dei templari nel anche la mansio di caggiano fu ceduta agli ospitalieri il primo signore di caggiano di cui si abbia notizia è un certo guglielmo de cauciciano citato in un atto di donazione del conservato nell archivio della badia di cava da questi la signoria passò al figlio roberto che in un primo momento vi associò anche i fratelli guglielmo e omfrida e successivamente al figlio di roberto ruggero nel i fratelli roberto e guglielmo presero parte alla congiura di capaccio contro il ghibellino federico ii di svevia e a favore del guelfo carlo i d angiò con il fallimento della congiura i fratelli dovettero rifugiarsi a roma mentre il feudo di caggiano venne loro confiscato e nel alla morte di federico ii venne attribuito all illustre medico salernitano giovanni da procida in seguito alla vittoria di carlo d angiò su manfredi di svevia a benevento nel il feudo fu nuovamente restituito roberto di cauciciano figlio dello spodestato guglielmo insieme ai casali di sant angelo le fratte e di salvitelle nel il feudo passò a mattia gesualdo che aveva sposato costanza ultima discendente legittima della famiglia dei cauciciano la signoria dei gesualdo il nuovo signore di caggiano si mantenne fedele agli angioini nel fu nominato da carlo i giustiziere della basilicata e quattro anni dopo fu nominato cavaliere da carlo ii espanse inoltre i suoi domini acquisendo anche pertosa castiglione e paterno nel gli successe il primogenito niccolò e a questi prima il figlio giovanni e poi l altro figlio mattia che acquistò la signoria di pescopagano e fu ciambellano di roberto d angiò e della regina giovanna luigi gesualdo partecipò alla congiura dei baroni contro ferdinando ii d aragona e fu quindi privato del suo feudo mentre il castello veniva in parte demolito il feudo venne affidato a giacomo caracciolo conte di buccino che fece ricostruire le fortificazioni dopo la firma dell armistizio di lione tra luigi xii di francia e ferdinando d aragona nel luigi gesualdo fu reintegrato nei suoi precedenti possedimenti morì nel dicembre del nel corso del xv secolo caggiano aveva anche dato i natali agli umanisti gabriele altilio e crisostomo colonna nel la signoria dei gesualdo ebbe termine con gianbattista ludovisio principe di venosa e di piombino e signore di caggiano che vendette il feudo a prospero parisani di tolentino la famiglia secondo l opuscolo veritatis statera di padre arcangelo da caggiano discendeva dalla nobile famiglia dei suardo di origini tedesche xvii xix secolo i parisani il marchese vincenzo parisani buonanno si distinse per un governo particolarmente duro ed oppressivo e fu denunziato nel al tribunale regio il marchese fu sottoposto ad un lungo processo che si concluse con un assoluzione dopo aver inutilmente tentato di assalire il castello i cittadini caggianesi lo denunziarono nuovamente e il nuovo procedimento giudiziario si protrasse fino alla vigilia della rivoluzione francese la diffusione degli ideali rivoluzionari fece nascere anche a caggiano un club della libertà guidato da vincenzo lupo e da giuseppe antonio abbamonte il regime borbonico arrestò il primo e costrinse all esilio il secondo che divenne in seguito segretario generale del ministro delle finanze nella repubblica cisalpina nel quando il generale francese championnet proclamò a napoli la repubblica napoletana abbamonte conosciuto a caggiano come don peppe fu nominato presidente del comitato centrale l ordinamento delle amministrazioni locali istituito durante l occupazione francese e i regni di giuseppe bonaparte e di gioacchino murat con il consiglio comunale decurionato che eleggeva il sindaco sopravvisse alla restaurazione i caggianesi presero parte ai moti del e del il paese venne inoltre colpito da una notevole crisi economica e si sollevò ancora nel in seguito alla nuova suddivisione amministrativa del regno di napoli il paese fece parte del distretto di sala nel principato di citeriore e fu capoluogo di circondario nella notte tra il e il dicembre del fu colpito da un forte terremoto dal al durante il regno d italia divenne capoluogo dell omonimo mandamento appartenente al circondario di sala consilina la crisi si perpetuò fino alla fine del xix secolo incrementando il fenomeno dell emigrazione soprattutto verso gli stati uniti il venezuela l argentina e il brasile xx secolo primo e secondo dopoguerra soprattutto a partire dal secondo dopoguerra il paese si è sviluppato ed esteso a valle delle vecchie mura di cinta ed il centro storico si è progressivamente spopolato oggi caggiano è così diviso in due aree il centro storico di origine romano medioevale racchiuso tra le mura e l area moderna in questi ultimi anni però forestieri hanno cominciato ad acquistare case proprio nel centro storico per trascorrervi i periodi di ferie ed il fine settimana la popolazione ha accusato sensibili flessioni demografiche in corrispondenza di ondate migratorie verso le americhe essenzialmente usa all inizio del xx secolo e tra le due guerre mondiali ed ancora le americhe oltre che verso gli usa anche in direzione di venezuela ed argentina ma progressivamente sempre più spesso l europa essenzialmente la germania occidentale ed il nord italia nel secondo dopoguerra in particolare tra il ed il la popolazione è passata da abitanti a perdendo unità ovvero una media di persone l anno nel ventennio si è passati da abitanti a perdendo unità pari a persone annue oggi la popolazione si è attestata poco sopra le unità la prima guerra mondiale causò diverse vittime tra i paesani morti in combattimento dispersi in prigionia ed altri per malattie contratte in guerra e altre ne fece la seconda guerra mondiale morti in combattimento dispersi e per malattia dal al è stato capoluogo dell omonimo mandamento appartenente al circondario di sala consilina le principali attività economiche sono l agricoltura l allevamento l artigianato ed il commercio i maggiori prodotti ricavati dal terreno sono cereali olive ed uva scarsa è la superficie boschiva per la maggior parte di demanio comunale sono inoltre presenti alcune piccole aziende manifatturiere meccaniche e di trasformazione alimentare il terremoto del novembre contrariamente a quanto avvenuto nei comuni limitrofi ha solo sfiorato caggiano senza provocare né morti né feriti tanto che nell occasione già nelle prime ore successive all evento partirono gruppi di volontari per soccorrere i paesi vicini d altra parte anche in passato eventi sismici distruttivi hanno più spesso risparmiato caggiano di quanto non sia successo ai comuni che lo circondano il comune ha recentemente deliberato per il referendum correlato al progetto grande lucania stemma l attuale stemma del comune è sormontato da una corona turrita e contornato da due rami uno di quercia ed uno di ulivo emblema della repubblica italiana uniti alla base con un nastro in esso è raffigurato non un imponente maniero con due alte torri ed un torrione merlati che si erge su un rigoglioso prato verde quello riprodotto sui documenti ufficiali del settecento reca invece la sagoma di una figura umana non abbastanza decifrabile un breve studio del prof carmine paolo carucci dal titolo illustrazioni dell antico stemma civico di caggiano ne spiega il mistero sullo stemma civico di caggiano rinvenuto nel r eale grande archivio di napoli scrive il carucci è effigiato un personaggio di aspetto giovanile in atto di chi cammina coverto di giaco con fascia a tracolla che finisce con due svolazzi al fianco sinistro col petto fregiato di una croce con corona marchionale sulla testa e con la mano destra poggiata su d un speciale bastone sulla cui estremità superiore vedesi disegnato un edificio che termina in alto con cupola con base circolare circondata da fortilizi la mano sinistra ha l indice piegato verso il suddetto edificio indicando la meta da raggiungere ed in basso dallo stesso lato ad una certa distanza osservasi una mezzaluna il tutto circondato da una corona ovale di foglie di lauro la concessione di tale stemma all università di caggiano evidentemente allude al memorabile fatto storico al quale prese parte alberedo signore di caggiano nella spedizione della prima crociata l edificio figurato sull estremità del bastone rappresenta la basilica del santo sepolcro di cristo volendo significare che i caggianesi sotto il comando del loro signore vanno alla conquista del s anto sepolcro per riscattarlo dal dominio islamico caggiano nelle mappe antiche numerose sono le mappe

salvatore e s caterina dialetto la parlata locale tuttora diffusa a livello familiare ha affinità con quelle lucane della basilicata e come molte altre dell italia meridionale presenta influssi dal greco cultura cucina la cucina tradizionale di caggiano è tipicamente contadina in quanto i suoi ingredienti fondamentali e condimenti sono tutti frutto dei suoi campi e dell allevamento ad eccezione del sale da cucina dello zucchero e di spezie come il pepe inoltre sviluppatasi in un epoca in cui l autoproduzione era la norma per la distanza che separa l abitato dal mare quasi assente è il pesce ad eccezione di quello conservato e quindi commercializzato sotto sale alici e baccalà la fertilità e varietà del territorio ha comunque permesso lo sviluppo di una cucina molto ricca il comune infatti si estende dai metri fino ai m s l m sostenendo un gran numero di coltivazioni grano orzo granturco vite ulivo noce castagno patate lupini pomodori lattuga rapa cavolfiore zucca meli peri cachi ceci fagioli granturco pesche prugne fichi anche se in via di abbandono una volta la pastorizia era praticata capillarmente nei tempi andati erano molte le famiglie che possedevano qualche capra o pecora così come l allevamento di animali da cortile le galline al calar del sole trovavano rifugio nelle stesse abitazioni dei loro proprietari e per i più ricchi il maiale non mancavano i conigli meno praticato era l allevamento di bovini oggi molto diffuso per tutte queste ragioni la tradizione culinaria caggianese in ogni stagione offre piatti legati alla ciclica disponibilità di ingredienti da notare che alcuni prodotti un tempo erano acquistati sempre dai paesi vicini perché inspiegabilmente si era convinti che non potessero crescere a caggiano era il caso dell aglio da polla delle cipolle da sant arsenio o delle verze da sant angelo le fratte lo scambio spesso avveniva in occasione di fiere e mercati che periodicamente si tenevano nei diversi comuni i primi piatti la pasta l impasto per la preparazione della pasta è molto povero essendo normalmente costituito di sola farina ed acqua circa cm di acqua per kg di farina solo per alcuni formati speciali ad es per le sfoglie sono occasionalmente aggiunte delle uova il tipo di pasta fatta in casa più diffuso perché di più semplice preparazione è il cavatìedd o cru sìcchi cavatello preparato in diversi formati a seconda del tipo di condimento se cavato con un dito è ottimo con salsa di pomodoro e in generale condimenti da mangiare con il cucchiaio patate fagioli piselli se cavato con due o più dita si sposa bene soprattutto con le verdure verza broccoli un altro formato molto diffuso perché di semplice preparazione è la là a na che si accompagna sempre con legumi o verdure raramente con salsa di pomodoro è preparata tagliando in striscioline di alcuni millimetri una sfoglia arrotolata nel cui impasto sono state eventualmente utilizzate anche uova il risultato è simile a delle strette fettuccine particolarmente apprezzate sono là a ne e cìc r cioè là a ne e ceci insaporiti in bianco prezzemolo aglio e cipolla a pezzetti appena soffritti nell olio con l aggiunta eventuale di vn drè sc ca pancetta tagliato a dadini la là a na era specialmente diffusa sia perché di preparazione veloce sia perché adatta ad essere conservata per più giorni i condimenti brodosi con cui si sposa bene la rendevano inoltre un economico riempipancia da notare che in dialetto caggianese solo usata al plurale la parola là a na individua il tipo di pasta appena descritto mentre al singolare indica la sfoglia la anatù r è invece il mattarello utilizzato per stendere la sfoglia le zucuarèdd sono la versione caggianese e casalinga degli spaghetti preparato con un impasto di sola farina ed acqua tradizionalmente ciascuna zucuarèdda è ordinata in spirale per essere più semplicemente prelevate per buttarla nell acqua bollente si condiscono con la salsa di pomodoro le tagliarelle sono invece le tagliatelle preparate a partire dalla sfoglia stesa e tagliata in striscioline di circa un centimetro di larghezza i formati di pasta più ricchi ed importanti sia per gli ingredienti sia per i tempi di preparazione sono certamente fusì dd fusillo e graviù ol raviolo in entrambi i casi l impasto prevede l aggiunta di uova i fusì dd sono un tipo di pasta lunga di forma irregolare è lavorato intorno ad un ferro angolato e sottile una volta ricavato dagli stecchetti degli ombrelli la sua preparazione è particolarmente lunga perché deve essere lasciato a ngru sc scuà o assucuà cioè ad asciugare o disseccare per alcune ore altrimenti maneggiandolo quando è ancora fresco anche solo per buttarlo nell acqua bollente si schiaccia o si ostruiscono le estremità impedendone una cottura uniforme il graviù ol è il classico raviolo preparato a partire da una sfoglia il ripieno è costituito da un impasto di ricotta uova formaggio e prezzemolo tagliato a pezzetti sono conditi sempre con salsa di pomodoro e formaggio per quanto riguarda i primi una menzione a parte meritano parmarìedd e tagliulì n il parmarìedd è la variante del cavatello da mangiare per tradizione la domenica delle palme il suo impasto prevede l aggiunta di uova ed è cavato a tre o quattro dita per farlo rassomigliare ad una foglia di ulivo lo si condisce con salsa di pomodoro i tagliulì n sono una variante della là a na preparata per l ascensione il suo impasto prevede uova e si differenzia dalla là a na perché la sfoglia arrotolata è tagliata ancora più sottilmente fìn cò m nu capèdd sottile come un capello anche la preparazione è particolare prima di aver raggiunto la cottura completa in acqua sono scolati e quindi versati nel latte bollente per terminarla sono quindi serviti nello stesso latte in cui hanno completato la cottura una volta il latte era quello fresco di pecora oggi ci si accontenta di latte intero a lunga conservazione la pasta preconfezionata infine ancora fino agli anni sessanta del secolo scorso era acquistata sfusa e consumata solo nelle giornate di festa come il pranzo della vigilia di natale chi poteva acquistava un po di spaghetti che condiva con il baccalà al sugo o per chi non poteva permetterselo con le alici salate queste ultimi sono i due unici primi a base di pesce della tradizione caggianese i condimenti la salsa al pomodoro era un condimento che al di fuori del periodo di disponibilità del prodotto fresco era riservato solo alle feste nel resto dell anno infatti si poteva consumare solo quella che ciascuna famiglia confezionava sottovuoto in agosto e settembre usanza ormai sempre meno praticata per la passata il pomodoro era bollito per qualche minuto quindi punto con una forchetta per liberarlo dall acqua era poi ridotto in poltiglia con un passatutto o un passa pomodoro che separava anche la polpa da pellicina e semi il sugo così ottenuto era versato in recipienti di vetro bottiglie o vasetti che poi erano ermeticamente sigillati e quindi bolliti pellicine e semi prodotti di scarto della lavorazione non venivano buttati ma riciclati come concime in alternativa si preparavano le zammedd cioè pomodori con la buccia l ortaggio era tagliato a pezzetti e liberato dai semi quindi versato crudo nei vasetti di vetro che erano poi ermeticamente sigillati e quindi bolliti questo condimento era impiegato anche per le pizze al pomodoro alcuni preparavano anche il concentrato di pomodoro lasciando essiccare al sole la passata cotta così confezionata la salsa poteva essere consumata anche dopo anni i legumi più spesso utilizzati come condimento dei primi erano e sono fagioli ceci e quando disponibili fave e piselli freschi i legumi infatti coniugano all elevato contenuto energetico una semplice coltivazione una volta essiccati inoltre sono facilmente conservati in dei semplici sacchi anche per mesi li si preparano di solito in bianco su un fondo di aglio o cipolla soffritti i legumi essiccati così come il grano erano una volte sfruttati anche per conservare le uova tra i chicchi infatti la temperatura è costante per tutto l anno e così le uova vi potevano essere conservati per lungo tempo fino a qualche fiera dove erano barattate con altro o accumulate in vista di qualche occasione particolare ad es una festa di matrimonio per quanto riguarda le verdure molto apprezzate sono verze e broccoli anche loro preparate in bianco in abbondante brodo e su un fondo di aglio soffritto con l eventuale aggiunta di un pomodoro tagliato a pezzetti grossi una volta quando qualche famiglia non possedeva un terreno adatto alla loro crescita spesso trovava più redditizio fittare da un conoscente qualche solco di un terreno migliore da lavorare in proprio non potevano mancare naturalmente le patate prodotte in grande quantità nelle zone montane indipendentemente dalla base utilizzata per il condimento a piacere tanti accompagnano i primi con il peperoncino essiccato o quando è fresco morsicato piatti a base di carne per motivi prettamente economici la dieta di una volta era povera di carne ed uova la carne infatti era un bene che anche i più ricchi si concedevano raramente i più allevavano gli animali per venderli così da pagare le tasse prima fra tutte la funduaria la patrimoniale o comprare scarpe ed abiti quando però vendevano la carne già macellata conservavano per sé le parti meno pregiate che poi sfruttavano inventando piatti poveri ma capaci di dare soddisfazione a tutta la famiglia tra questi la pèttla è forse il piatto di carne povero per eccellenza necessitando della sola pelle di pollo questa è tolta all animale la più integra possibile quindi imbottita con un impasto a base di pane uova formaggio prezzemolo infine completamente richiusa con ago e filo prima di essere bollita in un brodo solitamente vegetale è servita tagliata a fette una variante decisamente più ricca e moderna è la mbutt tùra dove al posto della pelle di pollo si usa la pancetta di vitello la lingua di bue è una parte dell animale capace di fornire tanta carne prima però deve essere bollita a lungo così da poterla scorticare per liberarla dalla superficie ruvida che la riveste e protegge consentendo all animale di mangiare anche erbe spinose la carne è invece molto morbida e può essere preparata a piacere il suo sapore dolciastro è facilmente mitigato cuocendo la carne nel vino bianco anche per questo è particolarmente adatta per le pizzaiole aglio origano pomodori a pezzetti ed un po d olio il cui sugo è buono anche per condire la pasta per quanto riguarda il maiale è noto che dell animale si sfrutta tutto la lavorazione delle sue carni è un operazione molto delicata da eseguire entro poche ore dall uccisione per impedire che i batteri l attacchino rovinandola irreparabilmente per questa ragione un rito che si ripeteva innumerevoli volte nell abitato come nei casolari in campagna tra la fine dell autunno e l inizio dell inverno era proprio l uccisione dei maiali a cui i proprietari chiamavano a partecipare un congruo numero di parenti e conoscenti con i quali si mangiavano le parti meno pregiate a pranzo e cena in cambio di un aiuto nella macellazione e nella preparazione dei salumi il tutto doveva concludersi nel giro di uno due giorni al massimo salsicce capocolli sopressate erano poi lasciati stagionare appesi al soffitto della cucina per sfruttare il fumo dei focolari per ucciderlo il maiale era bloccato da un buon numero di persone su una panca quindi gli si recideva la giugulare e l animale moriva dissanguato dopo un agonia di alcuni minuti questa macabra procedura era giustificata dalla necessità di dissanguarlo per impedire che il sangue coagulandosi ne rovinasse le carni oggi la disponibilità di macchine che velocizzano la macellazione e lavorazione consente di uccidere l animale molto velocemente quando invece tali operazioni erano svolte manualmente non era assolutamente possibile evitarlo comunque neppure il sangue era buttato ma raccolto e poi bollito con l aggiunta di zucchero cacao e cioccolato fino a formare il sanguinaccio un dolce molto ricercato fra le parti povere del maiale c è la cotica ed il lardo la cotica la si mangia in diversi modi ad esempio come involtini conditi con aglio e prezzemolo cotti nella salsa di pomodoro in questo modo anche il sugo diventa più ricco e aderisce ben bene alla porosità tipica della pasta fatta a mano il lardo era particolarmente apprezzato perché messo sotto sale e riposto in un luogo fresco può essere conservato per diversi mesi la sua salamoia inoltre era recuperata per condire la pasta risparmiando così sul sale un condimento indispensable quanto costoso sciogliendolo in una pentola dal lardo si ricava lo strutto se fritto a pezzetti la parte che si scioglie raffreddandosi diventa ancora strutto il resto delle bontà croccanti da mangiare caldi frìtt le cigole un pugno di frìtt le può anche essere utilizzato per condire l impasto per preparare il

si trova a un paio di chilometri dal lago maggiore e dall eremo di santa caterina del sasso origini del nome il toponimo dovrebbe indicare l antica presenza sul territorio di una chiesa intitolata a san giovanni non a caso nei documenti più antichi il paese viene menzionato come sangiuan scanzan o sanzano dai quali col passare del tempo si sarebbe giunti a sangiano le fonti storiche non fanno diretto riferimento al culto di questo santo ma parlano di una chiesa e un altare siti nel vicino territorio di leggiuno oltre a un battistero presso san clemente monte picuz visibile almeno fino al xvi secolo a questa teoria se ne aggiunge un altra formulata dall olivieri dizionario di toponomastica lombarda che vede nel toponimo un derivato dell appellativo sencia o singia dal latino cingula da intendersi come traslato geomorfologico per designare striscia sottile di terreno storia la comunità di sanzano appartenente alla pieve di leggiuno fu nominata per la prima volta negli statuti delle

it,il nazionalismo liberale noto anche come nazionalismo civico o nazionalismo civile è una forma di nazionalismo che si associa ad alcune caratteristiche del pensiero liberale che crede in una forma di nazionalismo anti xenofoba e anti razzista che è compatibile con i valori liberali di libertà tolleranza uguaglianza e rispetto dei diritti individuali ernest renan e john stuart mill possono essere identificati come i primi nazionalisti liberali i nazionalisti liberali difendono i valori dell identità nazionale che credono essenziali per condurre una vita autonoma e indipendente e che la società democratica ha bisogno di identità nazionale al fine di funzionare correttamente il nazionalismo liberale è la forma di nazionalismo in cui lo stato trae legittimità politica dalla partecipazione attiva dei suoi cittadini alcuni principi nazionali liberali inoltre si ritrovano nel pensiero di jean jacques rousseau e in particolare le sue teorie del contratto sociale che prendono il nome dal suo libro del contratto sociale il nazionalismo liberale si trova all interno delle tradizioni del razionalismo e del liberalismo ma come una forma di nazionalismo che è in contrasto con il nazionalismo etnico l adesione civica alla nazione è considerata volontaria come si può notare nella frase di ernest renan qu est ce qu une nation con una sorta di referendum quotidiano caratterizzato dalla volontà di vivere insieme e da qui anche il modo di identificare il nazionalismo liberale come nazionalismo civico come difatti molto spesso viene definito gli ideali civici nazionali influenzarono lo sviluppo della democrazia rappresentativa in paesi come gli stati uniti e la francia come la dichiarazione di indipendenza degli stati uniti del e la dichiarazione dei diritti dell uomo e del cittadino del gli stati in cui le forme civili di nazionalismo predominano spesso ma non sempre sono ex colonie come stati uniti canada messico brasile e argentina in cui il nazionalismo etnico è difficile da costruire a causa della diversità di etnie all interno lo stato una notevole eccezione è l india un ex colonia di piantagioni in cui nazionalismo civico ha prevalso

odierna formazione del regno unito composto da inghilterra galles scozia e irlanda del nord il partito nazionale scozzese e il plaid cymru il partito del galles che sostengono l indipendenza dal regno unito il partito socialdemocratico e laburista che supporta una riunificazione dell irlanda del nord con la repubblica d irlanda e il partito alleanza del nord sono nazionalisti civici sinn fein che supporta anche una irlanda unita potrebbe anche essere considerata nazionalista civica inoltre il nazionalismo civico nell ucraina post sovietica ha prevalso dopo la rivoluzione arancione al di fuori dell europa il nazionalismo civico è stato anche usato per descrivere il partito repubblicano negli stati uniti durante la guerra civile ciò è in contrasto con i partiti politici nazionalisti etnici come il partito di estrema destra partito nazionale britannico e molti partiti nazionalisti etnici che sono in europa come la lega nord in italia il partito nazionale scozzese e plaid cymru sono stati i primi partiti politici a mettere in campo candidati di una minoranza etnica nelle istituzioni decentrate delle loro rispettive nazioni bashir ahmad al parlamento scozzese e mohammad asghar in galles tuttavia da allora ha disertato per i conservatori gallesi e dichiarato il suo sostegno per l unionismo britannico entrambi sono musulmani di origine britannica in italia forme di nazionalismo liberale moderno sono nate a partire dal su facebook dove con la creazione della pagina nazionalisti italiani da parte del professor nicola tagliafierro creatore del manifesto ideologico e del simbolo del movimento un italia cinta di alloro tra due barre verticali di colore verde e rosso nazionale venne a crearsi una comunità di nazionalisti di stampo liberale fino ad arrivare al febbraio quando i nazionalisti italiani provenienti da varie località italiane si costituiscono in associazione di promozione sociale non riconosciuta presso il terminal dell aeroporto leonardo da vinci di roma a fiumicino il deposito dello statuto associativo e la presentazione agli italiani è avvenuto il marzo sempre a roma presso l hotel dei congressi all eur i nazionalisti italiani ritengono che il concetto di nazionalismo sia il contraltare del concetto di globalizzazione e che vada promosso e valorizzato al fine di diffondere il senso di appartenenza di una comunità la convinzione che tale valore sia un deterrente contro la povertà contro l inquinamento ambientale lo sfruttamento dei territori e contro l isolamento degli individui favorito dalla globalizzazione forzata sta alla base

alla forza lavoro degli anziani è diminuita costantemente dal nel circa il degli intervistati giapponesi dichiarava di voler continuare a lavorare anche dopo aver compiuto anni come motivazioni venivano indicate sia ragioni economiche sia sanitarie altri fattori come una forte etica del lavoro e il centraggio dei legami sociali degli uomini intorno al posto di lavoro avevano anch essi una certa rilevanza il lavoro non era comunque sempre disponibile e gli uomini e le donne che sceglievano di lavorare anche dopo la pensione di solito andavano incontro a notevoli tagli di stipendio e a una diminuzione del prestigio professionale tra il e il la percentuale di persone di anni o più che facevano affidamento sulla pensione pubblica come fonte principale di reddito è passata dal al mentre quella di coloro che dipendevano da uno stipendio dal al la percentuale di coloro che si affidavano ai figli era invece diminuita dal al alla fine del xx secolo dalla fine del xx secolo si è verificato un cambiamento di tendenza che vede sempre più spesso le famiglie nucleari essere preferite alla tradizionale famiglia di tre generazioni sansedai kazoku da cui gli anziani abituati a valori diversi e che si aspettano di vivere con la famiglia del figlio durante la vecchiaia sono esclusi la percentuale di anziani che vive con i figli è diminuita dal del al del anche se questa percentuale era ancora di molto superiore a quella di altri paesi industrializzati anche il numero di anziani che viveva nelle case di riposo o di cura è aumentato dai circa del agli oltre del ma ancora questo gruppo era una piccola parte della popolazione anziana totale gli over che vivevano da soli o con il coniuge costituivano il secondo un sondaggio governativo meno della metà degli intervistati riteneva che fosse dovere del figlio maggiore occuparsi dei genitori ma il riteneva al contrario che fosse una cosa naturale nel giappone moderno i motivi che spingono gli anziani a vivere a casa dei figli sono cambiati rispetto al passato passando dall essere una soluzione ovvia per una società agricola a una possibile opzione per far fronte a circostanze come malattie o vedovanze tipiche di una società postindustriale nell era moderna in età contemporanea la salute degli anziani è responsabilità della società nel suo complesso l assistenza morale e materiale ai genitori anziani tuttavia viene vista ancora come un dovere che grava su tutti i familiari in particolare sulle nuore nel persone di età compresa tra i e i anni si occupavano personalmente delle necessità di un membro della famiglia più anziano nel si contavano comunque quasi due milioni di sessantenni che vivevano da soli ed estraniati dalla società e ogni anno migliaia di morti passano inosservate per giorni o addirittura settimane in un fenomeno moderno noto come kodokushi morte solitaria secondo una stima del governo nel le famiglie formate da ultrasessantacinquenni erano milioni di cui quasi milioni mononucleari invecchiamento della popolazione e terza età in giappone l invecchiamento della popolazione k reika shakai è uno dei principali problemi del paese secondo una stima riferita al una persona su quattro possedeva un età pari o superiore a anni corrispondente al della popolazione totale la più alta percentuale al mondo si prevede che entro il questi rappresenteranno il della popolazione totale il governo del giappone ha risposto alle preoccupazioni circa i problemi che i cambiamenti demografici possono comportare all economia e al benessere del paese con politiche volte tra le altre cose a rendere gli anziani più attivi all interno della società non solo molti anziani scelgono di continuare a lavorare anche dopo il raggiungimento dell età da pensione per combattere i problemi di salute psicologica e fisica ma alcuni scelgono di partecipare ad attività sociali di svago hobby e ikigai che significa approssimativamente ragione di vita per evitare di diventare un onere per le loro famiglie tenendosi occupati e produttivi gli anziani partecipano ad attività di volontariato nelle organizzazioni della società civile e nei progetti comunitari mentre altri si uniscono ai progetti di sviluppo all estero sotto gli auspici del corpo di volontariato d oltremare del giappone oltre alle attività fisiche anche le pratiche mentali sono incoraggiate come la lettura ad alta voce che è considerata utile per mantenere la propria capacità di concentrazione ed è più impegnativa della lettura in silenzio la popolazione anziana attiva inoltre dà vita a un fiorente mercato consumistico che va dal tempo libero all educazione e dall assistenza sanitaria agli immobili inoltre sono stati sviluppati vari robot per soddisfare il crescente numero di persone anziane tra questi vi sono i robot sociali progettati per generare risposte emotive o migliorare la comunicazione come paro o pepper nonché robot di assistenza fisica robot di servizio e robot da trasporto i robot appositamente progettati per aiutare gli anziani sono anche conosciuti come carebots e il loro sviluppo è fortemente finanziato dal governo giapponese invecchiamento della popolazione e sistema pensionistico dagli anni ottanta in poi l invecchiamento della forza lavoro e la carenza di giovani lavoratori hanno finito per cambiare le caratteristiche del lavoro in giappone compreso il sistema pensionistico nazionale durante la maggior parte del dopoguerra la soglia di età per andare in pensione era fissata a anni poiché i pagamenti per la previdenza sociale del governo iniziavano normalmente a anni i lavoratori erano costretti a trovare una nuova occupazione per riempire il divario quinquennale tuttavia nel la dieta approvò la legge relativa alla stabilizzazione dell occupazione per i più anziani per fornire diversi incentivi alle imprese in modo da portare l età di pensionamento a anni molte aziende giapponesi sollevarono ulteriormente l età pensionabile stabilita anche in risposta alla nuova legge e nonostante le politiche di pensionamento obbligatorie molte aziende giapponesi permettevano ai loro dipendenti di continuare a lavorare oltre i anni anche se percependo salari ridotti negli anni successivi il governo riformò nuovamente il sistema con l intenzione di portare gradualmente l età pensionabile da a anni nel quadro del sistema rivisto i contributi pagati in quote uguali da parte del datore di lavoro e del dipendente dovrebbero essere equivalenti a circa il dei salari a differenza del previsto dal vecchio sistema nel i lavoratori con un età pari o superiore ai anni erano milioni i motivi per cui così tante persone in età senile scelgono di continuare a lavorare sono vari per integrare i redditi pensionistici inadeguati per dare senso alla propria vita o per continuare a sentirsi parte della società centenari giapponesi il giappone si trova al primo posto nel mondo quanto ad aspettativa di vita alla nascita con una media di anni nel l arcipelago giapponese detiene anche il record per il maggior numero di centenari nel secondo le stime del ministero della salute vi sono centenari ogni abitanti rapporto che sfiora i ogni

it,i mallofagi mallophaga noti come falsi pidocchi degli animali o anche pidocchi pollini sono un ordine che comprende circa specie di parassiti epizoi di vertebrati omotermi in gran parte uccelli in piccola parte mammiferi e di insetti spiccatamente stenotermi le specie di mallofagi sono in buona parte infeudate agli uccelli con un adattamento tale che la loro classificazione è di aiuto nello studio di quella dei volatili che li ospitano sono divisi in sottordini ischnocera amblycera e rhyncophthirina morfologia insetti piccoli atteri secondari con livree di colori in genere chiari ed uniformi talora brunastri o anche neri in rapporto alle condizioni di vita sull ospite dal corpo appiattito il capo è grande libero abbastanza mobile depresso prognato con la regione clipeale sporgente oltre e dorsalmente all apparato boccale atta a raspare nonché a volte separata mediante un solco da quella retrostante nei rincoftirini risulta prolungato in un rostro occhi composti atipici poco sviluppati o atrofizzati ocelli assenti antenne libere esertili articolate talora modificate nei maschi per servire a tenere ferma la femmina durante la copula oppure nascoste in due fossette laterali del cranio articolate apparato boccale masticatore un po modificato posto ventralmente al cranio e più o meno spostato all indietro nei rincoftirini esso è apicale labrum infero e trasverso mandibole robuste denticolate orizzontali o verticali o anche con denticolazione rivolta verso l esterno cosicché esse producono il massimo sforzo in quella direzione mascelle accollate lateralmente al labium non differenziate negli usuali scleriti fornite di un solo lobo e in alcuni generi di una formazione bacilliforme spesso distalmente forcuta omologa alla lacinia degli psocotteri ma meno sviluppata con palpo presente e articolato o assente labium con palpi piccoli e lobiformi e con uno o due lobi mediali il complesso maxillo labiale appare rudimentale negli rincoftirini prefaringe simile a quella degli psocotteri con due scleriti linguali connessi mediante due filamenti sclerificati che si fondono insieme per un certo tratto con uno sclerite mediale adorale in alcune specie la prefaringe si differenzia distalmente in strutture simili a stiletti adatte a pungere l apparato boccale talora è modificato in succhiatore ed allora è alquanto simile a quello degli anopluri torace notevolmente depresso il protorace è quasi sempre libero nel pterotorace meso e metasterno sono quasi sempre uniti meso e metanoto talora uniti talora no nei rincoftirini tutti e tre i segmenti toracici risultano fusi tra loro zampi brevi e robuste lunghe e gracili nei rincoftirini le anteriori un po più corte con coxe separate tarsi articolati e pretarsi con unghie talora enormi talora rudimentali che posso piegarsi su una prominenza o una concavità della tibia a formare una pinza mancano i pulvilli e l empodio addome sessile tipicamente di segmenti il primo urite a volte si fonde col secondo il nono col decimo cerci assenti anatomia sistema nervoso apparato centrale fortemente concentrato con gangli toracici privi di connettivi e senza gangli addominali distinti apparato stomatogastrico con ganglio ipocerebrale assai ridotto apparato digerente canale alimentare breve dritto o leggermente convoluto fornito di ingluvie che manca nei rincoftirini questa è rappresentata da una dilatazione dello stomodeo oppure è più sviluppata a formare una sorta di sacco peduncolato o anche può essere proiettata indietro da un lato del canale e di un paio di ciechi gastrici anteriori voluminosi proctodeo semplice breve con papille rettali apparato respiratorio peripneustico con paia di stigmi paio toracico e addominali apparato circolatorio con vaso dorsale sviluppato cuore breve e provvisto di paia di ostioli sistema escretore con tubi malpighiani sistema secretore con due ghiandole salivari sboccanti mediante un dotto unico alla base del labium due altre ghiandole salivari fornite di serbatoio sboccano nell esofago anch esse mediante un dotto unico due ghiandole supplementari sboccano indipendentemente dell esofago apparato endocrino retrocerebrale con corpi cardiaci e corpi allati pari e ridotti apparato riproduttore ovari ciascuno con ovarioli meroistici politrofici la spermateca è variamente conformata e talvolta bipartita spesso fornita di una ghiandola accessoria la vagina sbocca dopo l ottavo urosterno in alcune specie essa è differenziata alla base degli ovarioli in un ampolla che ospita micetociti ovopositore assente oppure rappresentato da due piccole valve dell ottavo urite testicoli pari con follicoli ciascuno accollati oppure molto separati tra loro in questo caso quelli laterali sfociano lungo il decorso dei deferenti questi ultimi sono lunghi e sinuosi vescicola seminale spesso grande e bilobata simmetricamente eiaculatore di varia lunghezza e grossezza con o senza ampolla eiaculatrice biologia i mallofagi sono insetti pseudoametabolici ed ovipari la loro riproduzione è tipicamente anfigonica ma in alcune specie si sono accertati fenomeni di spanandrìa e di anandrìa e pertanto partenogenesi telitoca nell accoppiamento la femmina si posiziona generalmente sopra il maschio ventre contro dorso ma può sistemarsi anche sotto di esso dorso contro ventre nell amblicero giropoideo trimenopon hispidum burm schmutz i due sessi si dispongono ventre contro ventre le uova sono di forma varia e sono fornite cefalicamente di un opercolo che si stacca all atto della schiusa possono portare anteriormente vistose ornamentazioni e sono saldamente incollate dalla femmina ai peli o alle penne dell ospite mediante il secreto della ghiandola accessoria si trovano isolate o anche riunite in gruppi magari formati da elementi provenienti da femmine diverse le neanidi fuoriescono grazie ad un rompiguscio delle cuticola embrionale costituito da un gruppo cefalico di processi spiniformi durante lo sviluppo postembrionale subiscono mute prima di raggiungere lo stadio di adulto ecologia i mallofagi si nutrono in genere di frammenti necrotizzati e di desquamazioni epidermiche di peli penne forfora corion delle loro uova loro esuvie secreti sebacei spesso soprattutto fra gli ambliceri assorbono sangue che fuoriesce dalle ferite dei loro ospiti ma anche intaccano la pelle o i cannuoli delle giovani penne che hanno la papilla dermale riccamente vascolarizzata con il clipeo raspante o con l apparato boccale un caso singolare è quello di una specie del genere hirundoecus ewing che infesta le rondini da neanide si nutre dell umore acqueo presente sull orlo degli occhi dell uccello su cui vive da adulta si nutre di sangue nella digestione di queste sostanze carenti di principi nutritivi sono coadiuvati da microrganismi simbionti localizzati in cellule sparse che penetrano intere nelle uova per la trasmissione alla discendenza alcuni mallofagi si annidano addirittura nell asse delle penne sia se è vuoto sia se è ancora vascolarizzato le uova sono incollate ai peli o alle penne dell ospitatore il quale abitualmente tollera la presenza del parassita senza grosse complicazioni queste complicazioni invece si presentano nel caso di grosse infestazioni che conducono a dimagrimenti calo di produttività ecc per il diffondersi sulla pelle di una sorta di rogna ftiriasi tricodectica gli uccelli infestati in genere dimagriscono cambiano le penne improvvisamente depongono meno uova ed hanno vita più breve quelli ammalati sono più carichi di epizoi perché non si curano di spidocchiarsi gli uccelli domestici sono più attaccati che non le specie selvatiche gli uccelli tentano di difendersi facendo bagni di polvere e strofinandosi a volte sui formicai i mallofagi non attaccano mai l uomo ma attraverso il contatto con animali infestati possono trasmettergli cestodi o tenie eleggono sovente a loro residenza determinati territori del corpo dell ospite ma si trattengono dove il becco degli uccelli o i denti dei mammiferi non possono raggiungerli singolare è il caso delle specie del genere tetrophtalmus grosse che vivono nel sacco membranoso del becco dei pellicani e nella cavità boccale dei cormorani e presentano l apparato respiratorio adattato alle lunghe immersioni ciascuna specie di uccello ospita normalmente varie specie di mallofagi appartenenti a generi ed anche a famiglie diverse i mammiferi normalmente ospitano una sola specie accade anche che la medesima specie di mallofago si trovi su ospiti diversi che però sono sistematicamente affini e che mallofagi affini risultino infeudati ad ospiti anch essi affini può anche accadere che la vicinanza ad esempio di nidificazione di ospiti diversi porti una specie di mallofago ad insediarsi su animali sistematicamente assai lontani tra loro si è anche osservato che in individui appartenenti ad una data specie di uccelli si riscontrino ospiti sovraccarichi di epizoi ed altri quasi interamente immuni gli uccelli piccoli risultano raramente infestati i nidiacei meno degli adulti quelli che hanno subito una muta o che si cibano abitualmente di formiche risultano poco infestati la diffusione dei mallofagi avviene in occasione dell accoppiamento dei loro ospiti o nei nidi oppure durante i rapporti intercorrenti fra ospiti di specie gregarie oppure quando più individui dell ospite si soffregano nello stesso luogo altre volte il veicolo è rappresentato da un altro insetto soprattutto ditteri quando l ospite muore muoiono anch essi in breve tempo dopo avere o no tentato di abbandonare la spoglia di solito non resistono più di giorni raramente fino ad un paio di settimane caratteri dei sottordini ischnocera capo non particolarmente modificato antenne filiformi e libere articolate apparato boccale posto ventralmente nel cranio mandibole verticali mascelle senza palpi meso e metatorace comunemente fusi assieme zampe brevi e robuste gli iscnoceri sono torpèidi e pigri si muovono lentamente ed abbandonano con difficoltà l ospite dopo la sua morte perciò si ritrovano frequentemente rinsecchiti sugli animali conservati nelle collezioni vi appartengono le specie di trichodectes canis degeer ospite intermedio della tenia dypilidium canicum felicola subrostrata nitz del gatto damalina bovis linnaeus d ovis linnaeus d capris gur d equi linnaeus sui polli vivono diverse specie tra cui gonoides dissimilis den goniocotes hologaster nitz stenocrotopus gigas tasch lipeurus caponis linnaeus cuclotogaster heterographus nitz di colore brunastro lungo fino a mm vive sul capo e sul collo sul colombo vive columbicola columbae linnaeus amblycera capo non particolarmente modificato antenne nascoste in due fossette laterali del cranio e articolate apparato boccale posto ventralmente nel cranio mandibole orizzontali mascelle con palpi articolati meso e metatorace comunemente non fusi assieme zampe brevi e robuste gli ambliceri sono agili e svelti lasciano rapidamente l ospite morto e perciò si trovano raramente su animali imbalsamati o pelle a questo sottordine appartengono il menopon gallinae linnaeus mm il comunissimo pidocchio pollino e l eomenacanthus stramineus nitz mm giallastro che si nutre sui polli di sangue e preferisce perciò annidarsi nelle zone della pelle prive di penne altri generi sono infeudati a gruppi di uccelli come il genere upupicola cuculicola picicola anaticola tutti descritti da clay sia gli ambliceri sia gli iscnoceri comprendono un certo numero di famiglie con parecchi generi rhyncophthirina capo prolungato anteriormente in un lungo rostro all apice del quale si trova l apparato boccale masticatore succhiatore mandibole con denticolazione rivolta esternamente complesso maxillo labiale rudimentale pro meso e metatorace fusi assieme zampe lunghe e grecili a questo sottordine appartiene un solo genere haematomyzus piaget con due specie conosciute h elephantis piaget epizoo di elefanti e rinoceronti ed h hopkinsi clay epizoo di facoceri trattamenti in passato i falsi pidocchi venivano controllati immergendo gli uccelli in una soluzione di fluoruro di sodio allo ed i mammiferi venivano disinfestati con polveri a base di piretro e rotenone mescolate a zolfo oppure con saponi alla nicotina oggi questi mezzi sono stati sostituiti dall impolveramento degli animali con polveri secche a base di malathion e carbaryl disinfestazione dei locali con trattamenti liquidi a base degli stessi prodotti oppure a base di clororganici persistenti anche in polvere in caso di infestazioni gravi anche i mammiferi possono essere trattati con prodotti liquidi o immersi in essi bibliografia séguy e insectes ectoparasites in l chopard dir faune de france lechevalier paris

morosini la madre morì nel poco dopo aver dato alla luce il secondogenito cesare la famiglia vantava origini nobili e antichissime il suo casato discendeva da afranio burro prefetto del pretorio sotto claudio morto avvelenato da nerone il cognome burrus deriva da urus che in latino volgare è il bue selvatico l animale rappresentato nello stemma di famiglia il padre branda era un medico di fama dalle grandi capacità diagnostiche lo zio cesare era dottore collegiato e professore primario di legge presso l università di pavia fu probabilmente il padre a destare precocissimamente in lui l interesse per gli arcana naturae e per la scienza dell alchimia nel seminario romano per l educazione dei figli branda che non mancava di mezzi scelse uno dei maggiori istituti educativi dell italia del tempo il seminario romano qui insegnava l erudito athanasius kircher il grande cabalista gesuita autore dell oedipus aegyptiacus e del mundus subterraneus il criterio di ammissione era rigorosamente classista i giovani dovevano essere figli di persone nobili e delle prime case non solo d italia ma di tutta la cristianità i maestri gesuitici avevano caro borri e lasciavano che desse libero corso alle sue inquietudini intellettuali la sua intolleranza verso l autorità ecclesiale tuttavia deteriorò progressivamente il rapporto con gli insegnanti l insofferenza verso l eccessiva rigidezza dei metodi del seminario spinse borri ad organizzare e condurre una ribellione collettiva dei seminaristi nel marzo del per ristabilire l ordine fu necessario l intervento delle forze di polizia l iniziativa si concluse con la sostituzione del rettore e l espulsione di borri dall istituto durante la sua permanenza nel seminario borri ebbe modo di stringere durature amicizie con paolo negri ministro piemontese e con il conte bartolomeo canali entrambi parteciparono alla ribellione dei seminaristi dopo l espulsione borri continuò gli studi iniziando la propria attività di medico e di alchimista in questo periodo ebbe anche i primi contatti con il marchese massimiliano palombara tra rationi e vangeli di lì a poco avvenne l evento decisivo della sua vita coinvolto in una rissa e costretto a cercare asilo in s maria maggiore borri fu visitato da una visione celeste egli si credette investito dall alto di una grande missione risanare la cristianità corrotta ed estendere a tutta la terra il regno di dio borri iniziò così la sua propaganda politica e messianica richiamando intorno a sé i primi seguaci egli era convinto che la religione fosse fondamento di tutte le discipline scientifiche e teorizzava la nascita di una teocrazia guidata dal papa una nuova età dell oro dove i valori di un cristianesimo rinnovato avrebbero trionfato secondo i registri dell inquisizione borri si considerava il prochristus profeta di una nuova era il aprile con l elezione a papa di alessandro vii chigi borri per via del suo pensiero politico si vide costretto ad abbandonare roma si trattenne un anno a napoli finché non giunsero i primi segni della peste condanna per eresia nel si spostò a milano e probabilmente affetto da lue si curò con un farmaco a base di mercurio che lo mandò in delirio mistico trovò una lombardia in pieno fermento religioso i tribunali dell inquisizione reprimevano in quel tempo le manifestazioni di quietismo diffuso soprattutto nelle valli bresciane bergamasche e nella stessa milano particolarmente profonda su di lui fu l influenza di giacomo casolo uomo laico analfabeta ma dal grande carisma casolo fu condannato per eresia dal tribunale dell inquisizione e morì a brescia nel giugno del borri divenne presto una figura guida del movimento quietista tenendo numerosi discorsi presso l oratorio di s pelagia la sua predicazione culminò in un comizio pubblico nella piazza della cattedrale di milano le conseguenze della notorietà non tardarono ad arrivare e borri venne prontamente incriminato per veneficio in riferimento alle sue pubbliche e propagandate conoscenze alchemiche nel due suoi seguaci furono arrestati e fecero il suo nome l anno successivo venne aperta a roma un indagine a carico di borri con l accusa di eresia gli fu intimato di comparire in giudizio entro novanta giorni egli tuttavia non si presentò nel datosi prontamente alla fuga in svizzera borri apprese la notizia della morte del padre nel fu condannato in contumacia dall inquisizione romana i suoi seguaci milanesi abiurarono e nello stesso anno una sua effigie venne pubblicamente bruciata in campo de fiori in svizzera borri continuò a curarsi col mercurio e in virtù dei suoi studi di medicina si dedicò alla cura della sifilide uomo di scienza o ciarlatano nel borri si trasferì a strasburgo dove godette della protezione del senato e del favore dell ambiente protestante della città lo precedeva la sua fama estesa ormai all intero continente intorno a borri si creò una schiera di ammiratori che ne magnificava le doti di medico e iatrochimico l abilità da lui acquisita nel trattare il mercurio in tutti i suoi composti ne fece il più brillante alchimista dell epoca a strasburgo egli riuscì in una difficile operazione di cataratta riscuotendo grande successo tra i medici pratici come giovanni kueffer archiatra di molti principi principi tedeschi incontrò anche fierissime ostilità nel mondo universitario il professore melchior sebisch jr lo accusò di essere solamente un ciarlatano il peso delle accuse fu tale che di lì a poco gli fu intimato di abbandonare la città da strasburgo borri si mosse verso la germania visitò dapprima francoforte poi dresda e infine lipsia furono tutti soggiorni brevi nel dicembre del giunse nei paesi bassi ad amsterdam vi rimase sei anni e nel pubblicò il suo primo testo alchemico gli specimina quinque chymiae hyppocraticae durante la sua permanenza principi e mercanti affluirono per chiedergli consiglio in quegli anni borri estese i propri interessi oltre la medicina e l alchimia abbracciando la magia e l ingegneria riuscì ad ottenere due guarigioni straordinarie e forte della propria fama nel ottenne la cittadinanza onoraria la considerazione pubblica crebbe allorché nel cominciò a sperimentare sopra gli animali la sua tecnica per la rigenerazione degli umori oculari in preda a grande ansietà a causa della mancata restituzione di un prestito dopo sei anni borri abbandonò i paesi bassi in una lettera racconta che nel incontrò ad amburgo l ex regina cristina di svezia incassando un ingente somma di denaro per un imprecisata operazione poi si spostò a copenaghen alla corte di federico iii di danimarca accolto generosamente nei giardini del re ebbe modo di impiantarvi un sontuoso laboratorio in poco tempo borri divenne un fidato consigliere del sovrano ristabilendo la sua fama erano però numerosi i detrattori il celebre autore della chirurgia infusoria johann daniel major lo definirà anni più tardi bravo solo a mungere le borse dei ricchi henrik skriver chirurgo personale del re ripeté l esperimento di borri sulla rigenerazione degli umori oculari ottenendo gli stessi risultati e dimostrando l inutilità del liquido impiegato da borri tempo addietro la popolarità del medico milanese ne risultò intaccata borri non si sentiva più sicuro presso la corte di copenaghen la malattia e la morte del re nel febbraio lo indussero ad abbandonare la città si era tra l altro inimicato simon paulli e gli altri medici di corte sconsigliando il salasso dell ultrasessantenne sovrano cristiano v nuovo re di danimarca si servì occasionalmente dei suoi servigi nel ricorrerà a borri per la cura di uno dei suoi figli colpito da un misterioso malore la cattura borri scelse la turchia come meta successiva ma il suo viaggio si interruppe in ungheria nell aprile fu fermato da una pattuglia che indagava su una congiura ai danni dell imperatore d austria leopoldo i il maggio borri fu condotto a vienna nonostante l opposizione di tanti ministri interessati alle competenze alchemiche e mediche di borri il medico fu consegnato al nunzio papale il giugno e scortato da una squadra di trenta soldati giunse a roma il luglio del roma e la morte nella città eterna contrariamente a quanto lo stesso borri si aspettasse non fu immediatamente giustiziato dalle autorità ecclesiastiche in molti si adoperarono per aiutarlo e dopo un nuovo processo la sua pena fu attenuata non venne arso al rogo ma condannato al carcere a vita nel il duca francesco d estrées si ammalò clemente x concesse a borri di uscire dalla prigione di castel sant angelo per curare il diplomatico francese nella sua residenza di palazzo farnese la popolazione accorse per vedere il medico all opera e l evento ebbe grande risonanza nella roma del periodo anche numerosi cardinali vollero ricorrere alle cure di borri e il nuovo pontefice innocenzo xi si dimostrò accondiscendente grazie alla ritrovata fama borri ebbe perfino la possibilità di proseguire le sue ricerche alchimistiche fu anche accolto nelle corti patrizie romane come alchimista sotto il falso nome di giustiniano bono nel aiutò il marchese palombara a edificare la famosa porta alchemica i cui resti oggi si trovano in piazza vittorio emanuele ii sull esquilino tutte le libertà di cui borri godeva gli furono però revocate nel per volere di papa innocenzo xii nel si ammalò di febbre malarica riconobbe il proprio male e chiese il rimedio adatto la corteccia di china il cui uso si andava allora diffondendo in europa il farmaco richiesto non fu tuttavia reperito in tempo il agosto all età di anni francesco giuseppe borri morì nella sua cella a nome di borri e mentre era ancora in vita circolarono numerosi libri e manoscritti di argomento diverso alcuni dei quali sicuramente non suoi altri di attribuzione più incerta ma tutti accomunati dal deliberato utilizzo del suo nome a scopi polemici o editoriali borri e la medicina nel xvii secolo al tempo di borri la medicina mancava ancora del rigore metodologico e della capacità terapeutica che in futuro ne avrebbero fatto una scienza essa attingeva spesso al sapere frutto di altre discipline i due modelli preferiti della medicina del periodo erano la chimica e la fisica borri si ispirò prevalentemente alla scuola iatrochimica il cui esponente più noto fu certamente paracelso medico e alchimista svizzero alcuni degli obiettivi dell avventuriero italiano erano infatti la scoperta della pietra filosofale e la sintesi di un acqua perfettissima con proprietà simili all elisir di lunga vita in accordo con la teoria iatrochimica secondo la quale il corpo umano è come una fornace alchemica nella quale giocano un ruolo fondamentale i tria prima zolfo mercurio e sale borri condusse spesso esperimenti sulle proprietà terapeutiche degli elementi minerali impiegò ad esempio la terapia della maturazione con impiastri emollienti come l empiastro di paracelso o l empiastro magnetico a base di arsenico cristallino solfo vivo antimonio crudo per la cura della peste alcuni degli esperimenti medici di borri risentono ancora degli influssi della teoria umorale di origine ippocratica ne è esempio l esperimento sulla rigenerazione degli umori oculari la rigenerazione degli umori oculari durante la sua permanenza ad amsterdam borri ebbe modo di sperimentare la sua tecnica per la rigenerazione degli umori oculari il procedimento era il seguente affondato il bisturi nell occhio dell animale da esperimento borri svuotava il bulbo oculare dei suoi tre umori vitreo acqueo e cristallino poi mediante siringa iniettava la sua acqua medica la cui natura teneva segreta che era in grado di concrescere in triplice sostanza riproducendo i tre umori e ripristinando così la salute dell occhio dopo nove giorni infatti la visione risultava totalmente recuperata per molti sostenitori si poteva sperare d intervenire prossimamente anche sull uomo l acqua medica di borri si rivelò però superflua nel processo di rigenerazione degli umori oculari come dimostrò il regio chirurgo henrik skriver anni dopo a copenhagen la leggenda della porta alchemica nel l erudito francesco girolamo cancellieri raccontò la leggenda della porta alchemica i protagonisti della vicenda sono il marchese palombara ed un misterioso pellegrino una mattina nel giardino del nobile palombara penetrò uno sconosciuto intento a raccogliere erbe ne cercava una in particolare capace secondo la leggenda di produrre l oro l uomo condotto innanzi al marchese dalla servitù della villa dichiarò d essere un alchimista e di poter dimostrare la realizzabilità della trasmutazione dei metalli in oro il marchese palombara sedotto dalle parole del pellegrino gli garantì l accesso al proprio laboratorio alchemico l uomo dopo aver dimostrato una maestria tale da lasciare attonito il marchese chiese ospitalità per la notte in una camera nei pressi del laboratorio così da poter controllare lo svolgimento del complesso processo alchemico promise inoltre che ad opera ultimata avrebbe risposto alle domande del marchese che per il momento però avrebbe dovuto garantirgli solitudine e quiete il mattino seguente il marchese palombara impaziente di apprendere di più circa l esito dell esperimento bussò dapprima alla porta chiusa del laboratorio e successivamente alla porta della stanza affidata all ospite senza ottenere alcuna risposta il pellegrino era sgattaiolato via da una finestra lasciando nel laboratorio un crogiolo rovesciato con in terra una striscia d oro puro ed un fascicolo di carte con appunti e simboli ermetici sull esperimento sono proprio questi i simboli che il marchese fece scolpire in alcuni punti della sua villa e soprattutto sulla famosissima porta alchemica la tradizione vuole che il misterioso alchimista fosse borri e che ai suoi appunti siano ispirate le complesse simbologie della porta alchemica scritti principali la virtù coronata roma gentis burrhorum notitia argentorati

slapstick a lo largo de su vida fue a menudo reconocido como el rey de la comedia biografía y carrera profesional era hijo de granjeros inmigrantes de origen católico irlandés su padre era herrero en la pequeña población de eastern townships a los años su familia se trasladó a connecticut la familia vivió durante un tiempo en la ciudad de northampton en massachusetts donde según su autobiografía

financiero de adam kessel y charles o bauman dueños de la new york motion picture company en fundó keystone studios en edendale los ángeles california todavía se conserva el edificio principal original el primer estudio y escenario totalmente cerrado de la historia del cine muchos actores de importancia iniciaron sus carreras con sennett incluyendo a mabel normand charlie chaplin raymond griffith gloria swanson ford sterling andy clyde the keystone kops bing crosby w c fields y roscoe arbuckle sus comedias eran famosas por sus disparatadas carreras de coches y sus batallas de pasteles su primera actriz fue mabel normand que se convirtió en una estrella y con la cual tuvo una tormentosa relación personal en sus películas figuraban un conjunto de chicas conocidas como las sennett bathing beauties las bellezas bañistas de sennett entre las cuales estaban juanita hansen y marie prevost también creó las kid comedies antecesoras de las películas de our gang la pandilla cuyo nombre se hizo sinónimo de comedia cinematográfica en keystone studios se convirtió en una unidad de producción autónoma de la ambiciosa triangle pictures corporation según sennett se aliaba con los peces gordos de la industria cinematográfica d w griffith y thomas harper ince en dejó la marca keystone y organizó su propia compañía mack sennett comedies corporation produciendo cortos cómicos de mayor duración y unos pocos largometrajes durante la década de sus cortos tuvieron gran demanda con estrellas como billy bevan andy clyde harry gribbon vernon dent alice day ralph graves charlie murray y harry langdon otras de sus grandes estrellas fueron ben turpin y mabel normand muchas de sus películas de los inicios de la década de fueron heredadas por warner brothers cuando esta compañía se fusionó con la distribuidora original first national warner añadió música y comentarios a varios de estos cortos pero eventualmente destruyó los elementos originales por problemas de espacio para el almacenaje como resultado muchos filmes de sennett especialmente los de su período más productivo y creador ya no existen a mediados de la década de la distribuidora pathé tenía un gran mercado pero tomó decisiones corporativas erróneas como intentar vender demasiadas comedias al mismo tiempo incluyendo las del principal competidor de sennett hal roach en paramount pictures y metro goldwyn mayer los dos principales estudios de hollywood notando los beneficios conseguidos por compañías como pathé y educational pictures se reincorporaron en la producción y distribución de cortos roach firmó con la mgm pero sennett y pathé se encontraron en dificultades ya que los centenares de exhibidores que previamente habían alquilado sus cortos se decantaron por los nuevos productos de mgm o paramount

en lanzar al mercado cinematográfico un corto sonoro en en fue nominado por la academia de las artes y las ciencias cinematográficas de hollywood en la categoría short subjects comedy hoy mejor cortometraje de ficción por producir the loud mouth y ganó la categoría short subjects novelty discontinuado en por su película wrestling swordfish a menudo se aferraba a técnicas obsoletas por lo cual sus películas de comienzos de la década de parecen pasadas de moda y pintorescas esto condenó su intento de volver al mercado cinematográfico con hypnotized protagonizada por los comediantes del género minstrel moran y mack sin embargo disfrutó de un gran éxito con comedias cortas protagonizadas por bing crosby estas películas fueron probablemente decisivas para que los productos de sennett fueran aceptados por paramount pictures el estudio de sennett no sobrevivió a la gran depresión la colaboración sennett paramount duró solo un año y fue forzado a la bancarrota en noviembre de pasó a un semi retiro dos años después a los años de edad tras haber producido más de mil películas mudas y varias docenas de películas sonoras durante su carrera de años la propiedad de su estudio pasó a mascot pictures posteriormente parte de republic pictures y muchos de sus empleados encontraron trabajo en columbia pictures entre sus últimos trabajos se incluye la dirección de buster keaton en timid young man y su aparición en hollywood cavalcade en facilitó material para la recopilación down memory lane fue retratado en la serie de televisión this is your life en y tuvo una aparición en abbott and costello meet the keystone kops falleció en a los años y fue enterrado en el cementerio holy cross en culver city california legado en marzo de mack senett fue premiado con un óscar

sierras de velasco aparecen en las imágenes satelitales como una y que se prolongra desde el bajo de santa rosa de patquía hasta el límite con catamarca a la latitud de la ciudad de la rioja se produce la birfucación que determina la existencia de los cordones oriental y occidental brazo occidental la ladera del lado oeste mide aproximadamente desde la intersección con la oriental km donde finaliza cerca de la localidad de alpasinche con predominancia árida en ella nacen diversos ríos de escaso caudal el más importante el río los sauces que abastece de agua al dique del mismo nombre y a la ciudad de la rioja también da origen a vertientes y ríos que suministran las localidades de la costa riojana como huaco pinchas chuquis aminga anillaco los molinos anjullon san pedro y al río san

unos km de la localidad de patquia y finaliza en sierras de baja altura casi en la mitad de su extensión la sierra corta su continuidad en una falla donde da lugar al río los sauces y forma la entrada al valle de sanagasta y posteriormente a la costa su falda oriental se caracteriza por ser árida y su occidental por ser húmeda esto debido a que del lado este se condensa la humedad de los vientos húmedos precisamente en esta región finaliza la región de las yungas en ella crecen bosques de quebrachos viscos molles y espinillos geología desde principios del siglo xx numerosos autores estudiaron la sierra de velasco siendo sus trabajos de índole regional entre ellos bodenbender realizó estudios geológicos en la parte meridional de la provincia de la rioja y al referirse a la sierra de velasco menciona que la falda oriental en la quebrada de la rioja está conformada por filitas mientras la pendiente occidental se compone de varias partes de gneis o lo que es más probable de granito gnéisico en la parte central describe un macizo granítico que ocupa la mayor parte de la sierra estas observaciones han sido esencialmente confirmadas por trabajos recientes que se están llevando a cabo en el centro y norte de esta sierra durante el período que se extiende desde el cámbrico inferior tardío hasta el ordovícico temprano se inició la subducción en el protomargen de gondwana y el consecuente magmatismo de arco evidenciado por los granitoides de arco descriptos en la sierra de velasco lazarte y tres unidades graníticas mayores fueron reconocidas en la sierra de velasco que forman parte de

costa junto a otros cuerpos menores el agrupamiento de estos plutones en el batolito aimogasta fue determinado sobre la base de las relaciones geológicas de intrusividad con granitoides deformados de edad ordovícica y cuyos contactos son a menudo fajas de protomilonitas a milonitas los plutones huaco sanagasta y san blas corresponden a granitos porfiroides fuertemente diferenciados y con moderada

afinsa compró en secreto en junio de el catálogo brookman por y lo presentó como prestigioso e independiente intervención la mañana del de mayo de afinsa fue intervenida judicialmente junto con otra empresa fórum filatélico acusada de estafa dentro de la operación atrio la policía arrestó a cuatro responsables de la misma entre ellos su presidente juan antonio cano y su fundador albertino de figueiredo y cerró sus sedes por orden judicial y a los pocos días fueron puestos en libertad sin fianza la compañía fue acusada de operar según un esquema piramidal y de no tener sellos de ser falsos o tenerlos sobrevalorados se vieron afectados los aproximadamente clientes de la empresa que formaron varias asociaciones para defender sus intereses desde la intervención el grupo está dirigido por

con empleados y poseía oficinas la filial en portugal se denominaba afinsa inversión juicios en febrero de la audiencia nacional dicta sentencia en la que no se deja lugar a duda de que se trataba de una empresa de carácter mercantil y no financiero tirando por tierra la teoría de que se tratara de empresas financieras de tipo piramidal pues no cumple ningún requisito no es financiera no opera con altas rentabilidades del o más a un corto periodo de tiempo o meses y la inversión sí tiene una contrapartida los sellos como acredita dicha sentencia pese a todo tras reconocer que no existía la causa de la intervención a saber que no se trataba de empresas de carácter financiero sorprendentemente con requiebros jurídicos exime de responsabilidad a todos los organismos que la hicieron posible y de esa manera libera al reino de españa de indemnizar a la empresa y a los afectados la audiencia nacional y el tribunal supremo del reino de españa en sendas sentencias de de febrero y de de diciembre de dejan claro que tenían carácter mercantil y por tanto que el considerarlas financieras para llevar a cabo la intervención fue una excusa y no la causa real de tan brutal decisión la causa fue una carta denuncia de un estadounidense louis corrigan agente del hedge fund kingsford capital en junio de adjunta en el expediente de la querella hay que conocer que la actividad principal de estos agentes de bolsa de alto riesgo consiste en operaciones en corto en las que toman acciones prestadas a cambio de un interés para venderlas posteriormente tienen que comprarlas y devolverlas el negocio consiste en comprarlas a un precio más bajo que el de la venta otro factor a tener en cuenta es que afinsa tenía una filial en los estados unidos escala que cotizaba en el nasdaq y que llevaba meses de continuas subidas tras varios intentos fallidos en la prensa estadounidense por desacreditar esta empresa y por tanto de hacer bajar los precios los hedge fund atacan directamente la empresa matriz afinsa en españa en el segundo trimestre de poco tiempo después de la publicación de esta carta el psoe a través de su revista puntos de vista de de mayo de insta a hacienda a denunciar los hechos a la fiscalía trámites que consigue en tiempos especialmente cortos ya que se logra en julio de pese a todo y a que la inspectora teresa yábar la considera financiera para poder tener un mínimo de apoyo para justificar su denuncia en el mismo informe que le llega a la fiscalía es perceptivo el del director del servicio jurídico de la agencia tributaria que con fecha de julio de considera que no se puede considerar estafa ni siquiera en grado de tentativa pese a que la denuncia estaba ya desde julio de no se intervino hasta el de mayo de justo días después de que venciera la última póliza de afinsa con la aseguradora lloyd s que aseguraba a las dos compañías afinsa y fórum también coincide que en los estados unidos se habían dado un inusitado número de órdenes de venta de las acciones de escala cuando el precio alto y la buena situación de la empresa no lo hacía aconsejable con lo que todo apunta a toma de posiciones cortas unos meses antes de la intervención y tras la intervención los precios de las acciones se desplomaron los hegde fund compraron las acciones a dólares para devolvérselas a los dueños mientras ellos las habían vendido meses atrás a los afectados por el escándalo afinsa sienten que el gobierno de españa no les ha respaldado en el proceso y que su interés ha sido la defensa de grandes grupos financieros y la evasión de responsabilidades en lugar de la defensa de los intereses de los ciudadanos afectados la fiscalía de delitos económicos de madrid investiga al presidente de manos limpias miguel bernad y a la abogada del sindicato virginia lópez

alrededor de la ubicación del rodaje llamando a la bbc para informarle que el tráfico en la zona estaba congestionado debido a que los conductores estaban tratando de ver a la cantante fotos de rihanna se filtraron en la internet ese mismo día el dueño del campo alan graham expresó su desagrado con respecto a la escena en que rihanna deja al descubierto sus senos en su campo y pidió a la producción que dejara de filmar diciendo cuando la filmación se hizo en mi mente inaceptable pedí que detuvieran el rodaje se me hizo evidente que la situación se estaba volviendo inadecuada exigí que se detuvieran y lo hicieron como el agricultor solicitó que el rodaje del video se detuviera la ubicación de rodaje fue trasladada a un lugar cerrado en el barrio titanic de belfast el de septiembre de donde se continuó con el rodaje del video sin fotógrafos o aficionados que se les permita ver a nada el video de la canción está nominado a un grammy para la entrega de estos en el se informó que a

hecho hasta ahora rihanna explicó con más detalle el concepto del video diciendo nunca había hecho un video como este este es probablemente uno de los más profundos videos que he hecho su todo sobre el amor que es como una droga el interés de hombres en el amor es el modelo y ex boxeador dudley o shaughnessy después del lanzamiento del video matsoukas explicó el contenido del vídeo en una entrevista con mtv nos encanta obviamente hacer imágenes provocativas pero siempre tratamos de impulsar definitivamente los límites creo que es porque al final en realidad no es en absoluto la violencia doméstica es realmente acerca de que es tóxico y que están en este viaje de drogas que sin duda juega un papel pero creo que también se trata de ser triunfante sobre las debilidades y ella lo es por que lo deja no es tratando de glorificar a ese tipo de relación las partes malas de él eso es lo que no queremos al final su salida que representa que lo consigue sacar fuera de su vida las drogas la adicción a los tóxicos y el eso es lo que lleva a su caída y trae un montón de daños también en una entrevista la directora pasó a explicar el contenido con respecto a la violencia en el hogar de rihanna diciendo que no es una recreación de la experiencia pasada de la cantante sino que rihanna está actuando en el video diciendo la canción es totalmente un delirio y esa es la sensación sólo la música corriendo en ti y entonces empecé a pensar acerca de las drogas la adicción el amor y la forma en que es una adicción todos hemos vivido los altibajos de estar en una relación tóxica en realidad se trata de los obstáculos que representa dejarlo ir pero al mismo tiempo lo bueno que te hace sentir así que es difícil dejarlo ir una vez más se remonta a una historia que todos nos podemos identificar no es la historia de rihanna es su historia en el video que lo realiza obviamente hay un montón de comparaciones con su vida real y eso no es en absoluto la intención es sólo que creo que la gente naturalmente debe ir allí porque el arte imita la vida y es una historia con la que todos se relacionan y que hemos experimentado todos al igual se basa en mi vida se basa en su vida se basa en tu vida como todo el mundo el video oficial contó para agosto de con más de millones de visitas en youtube sinopsis el video comienza con un monólogo sobre el amor y la angustia por un narrador invisible la modelo agyness deyn it s like you re screaming but no one can hear you almost feel ashamed that someone could be that important that without them you feel like nothing no one will ever understand how much it hurts you feel hopeless like nothing can save you and when it s over and it s gone you almost wish that you could have all that bad stuff back so you can have the good es como si estuvieras gritando pero nadie pudiera oírte casi te sientes avergonzada de que alguien pueda ser tan importante que sin él te sientes como si no fueras nada nadie jamás va a entender lo mucho que duele te sientes sin esperanza como si nada pudiera salvarte y cuando todo ha terminado y él se ha ido deseas poder tener todas esas cosas malas de nuevo para al menos tener algo bueno varias escenas de rihanna y su amante se intercalan a lo largo de la narración que representa situaciones diferentes entre sí las escenas entrecortadas muestran a la pareja en escenarios de amor y odio antes de que el audio de la canción comience los rayos se proyectan en una pared en la que rihanna está de pie el primer verso comienza rihanna y su amante una vez más demostrado en multitud de escenarios diferentes que representan la forma más completa de enamorados entre sí mientras que la participación en actividades divertidas como ir a los juegos en un parque de atracciones y comer en restaurantes de comida rápida en el coro las imágenes de las drogas varias pastillas y dilatación de las pupilas se muestran mientras que las escenas breves de rihanna y su novio preparándose para tener relaciones sexuales y sus varios grados de desnudez se muestran el coro continúa y el video abruptamente da cortes de rihanna y otras personas bailando con la música calvin harris funciona como el dj en la escena cuando el segundo coro comienza rihanna y su novio se ven felices corriendo frenéticamente en un supermercado empujándose unos a otros en un carrito de compra esta escena es interrumpida cuando rihanna y su novio empiezan a discutir airadamente mientras están en un coche el video luego progresivamente muestra a la pareja experimentando crecientes dificultades en su relación la pareja empieza a abusar físicamente entre sí posiblemente debido al abuso de drogas es durante el coro final en donde rihanna se ve vomitando también es vista desmayada en la calle mientras su novio trata de revivirla después de aparentemente tener lo suficiente rihanna decide dejar a su novio después de encontrarlo inconsciente en el piso de su apartamento el video termina con rihanna acurrucada en el

es,la goma laca es una sustancia orgánica que se obtiene a partir del residuo o secreción resinosa de un pequeño insecto rojo llamado gusano de la laca laccifer lacca o kerria lacca que habita en lugares del sudeste asiático como indonesia o sri lanka las dos mejores variedades en el mercado son la goma laca de color naranja que viene en forma de escamas finas y traslúcidas y la goma laca blanca ambas son solubles en alcohol historia el primer testimonio escrito de la goma laca se remonta unos años pero se sabe que la goma laca ya se había utilizado antes según el mahabharata el exterior de un palacio entero se revistió con goma laca la goma laca era de uso poco frecuente como materia colorante durante la época del comercio con las indias orientales merrifield cita el año para la introducción de la goma laca como un pigmento artistico en españa el lapis lazuli como pigmento ultramarino de afganistán ya se importaba mucho antes de esto el uso como pintura o barniz decorativo sobre grandes piezas de mobiliario se popularizó por primera vez en venecia y más tarde en toda italia hay una serie de referencias del siglo xiii a cassoni un tipo de cofre matrimonial de madera pintados o barnizados a menudo en dotes deliberadamente impresionantes como parte de matrimonios dinásticos la definición de barniz no siempre está clara pero parecen haber sido barnices basados en la resina de benzoino o en almáciga ambas comercializadas en todo el mediterráneo en algún momento la goma laca comenzó a ser utilizada también un artículo del journal of the american institute of conservation describe el uso de la espectroscopia infrarroja para identificar un recubrimiento de goma laca en un cassone del siglo xvi este fue también el período en la historia en la que el barnizador fue identificado como un oficio distinto separado tanto del carpintero como del uso artistico otro uso de la goma laca fue como cera de lacre en el libro de woods the nature and treatment of wax and shellac seals la naturaleza y el tratamiento de sellado de cera y goma laca se discuten las diversas formulaciones y el período en que la goma laca comenzó a ser añadida a los anteriores recetas de abeja el período de introducción generalizada parece ser alrededor de a cuando la sustancia pasó de ser una rareza en piezas muy decoradas a ser descrita habitualmente en los textos cotidianos origen de la goma laca el gusano de la laca vive y se alimenta de árboles que se encuentran en las selvas tropicales de estos países y exuda un material duro parecido a una concha que a veces lo envuelve y causa su muerte los cultivadores locales recogen las ramitas recubiertas y quitan de ellas el material parecido a la concha este residuo se machaca posteriormente para formar gránulos se coloca en sacos de tejido y se calienta sobre un fuego abierto hasta que el material comienza a reblandecerse y finalmente funde el exudado se recoge y se estira en hojas muy finas mientras aún está blando después de que estas hojas se han enfriado y endurecido se machacan una y otra vez para formar escamas las escamas se envasan en sacos y se distribuyen hacía todas las partes del mundo en droguerías se suele expender disuelta en alcohol desnaturalizado mezcla de etanol y metanol en una proporción determinada y es envasada en recipientes de vidrio o metal de distintas capacidades o bien en escamas a granel para realizar uno mismo la mezcla con el alcohol utilización durante la primera mitad del siglo xx la goma laca es la base de la industria del disco de gramófono de rpm y también en la fabricación de discos de acetato fue sustituido gradualmente por los plásticos sintéticos baquelita y el vinilo en sin embargo la producción de discos de pasta continuó en la década de en países del oeste otros países del mundo continuaron la producción hasta la década de entre sus usos se incluyen artículos diversos tales como marcos para fotos espejos peines o joyas placas o prótesis dentales estos objetos se hicieron desde mediados del siglo xix hasta la llegada de plástico durante la primera mitad del siglo xx las páginas en braille se encontraban también cubiertas con laca para protegerlas durante su manipulación incluso en la actualidad se utiliza en la composición de la tinta china la utilización más frecuente es para el tratamiento final de las superficies de madera de muebles e instrumentos musicales es uno de los tipos más antiguos de acabado debido a que seca rápidamente protege bien y tiene una larga duración con el desarrollo y preparación de barnices y lacas de síntesis industrial la goma laca ha perdido bastante la popularidad con la que gozaba antaño pero aún mantiene un lugar importante no sólo en el campo del acabado de la madera sino también en otras industrias puede ser utilizada para impermeabilizar superficies porosas y como capa aislante entre las capas de pintura en ciertas técnicas de bellas artes sobre todo en la pintura de témpera también se vende como fijador para dibujos a carboncillo y otros tipos su insolubilidad total en las esencias minerales y en esencia de trementina la hace valiosa como capa aislante en la pintura decorativa o de paredes la goma laca que se ha diluido en muchas ocasiones pierde sus propiedades de secado cuando se almacena por lo que es mejor no guardarla en estas condiciones antiguamente el alambre de cobre para bobinados podía llevar una capa de goma laca debajo del aislamiento de algodón como refuerzo eléctrico pero no resultaba conveniente por ser poco resistente a las altas temperaturas finalmente ambos aislamientos fueron sustituidos por el esmalte con el que actualmente viene recubierto industrias alimentarias y farmacéuticas sus propiedades alcalinas se utilizan para proteger los medicamentos durante el tránsito por el tracto digestivo y liberar el principio activo en el lugar correcto en el intestino delgado o el colon en agricultura se usa para proteger las manzanas que pierden su cera natural durante la recolección y limpieza así como para fijar las esporas que sueltan los níscalos cuando se cortan de cara a asegurar el crecimiento de más al año siguiente recibe el código e como aditivo alimentario los veganos evitan este producto ya que es de origen animal la goma laca puede ser un alérgeno de contacto los síntomas más frecuentes son la irritación de la piel tipos goma laca naranja el color natural de la goma laca es naranja transparente y cuando se aplica a una superficie tiende a variar ligeramente el color de esta no es apropiado aplicar goma laca naranja a un acabado decolorado o natural en primer lugar porque altera notablemente el color de estas maderas claras y en segundo en una aplicación desigual se apreciarán con claridad la superposición de los brochazos por lo que se recomienda su aplicación con muñequilla goma laca blanca en realidad es de color clara de huevo y eso es debido a que se extraen las ceras de su composición también se llama goma laca descerada es transparente y cuando se aplica a una superficie de madera se conserva el color natural de esta puede utilizarse sobre superficies oscuras pero es recomendable sobre todo para superficies claras decoloradas o teñidas en las que el tono de la madera debe quedar tal como es se diluye en alcohol en proporción de presenta sin embargo ciertas desventajas que hacen impracticable su uso en determinadas condiciones tiene tendencia a volverse blanca lechosa cuando está sometida a elevados grados de humedad dando a la superficie una apariencia velada y sucia además debido a los productos químicos blanqueadores que se le añaden en su producción la durabilidad de esta se acorta algo con respecto a su homóloga naranja véase también

industrial superó hace años a la tradicional agrícola el término municipal de montmeló de escasa extensión territorial km se extiende por el valle bajo del congost y su confluencia con la riera del

barcelona cataluña donde se disputan el gran premio de españa de fórmula y el gran premio de cataluña de motociclismo campeonato mundial de motociclismo ambas carreras han ganado en más de una ocasión el premio a mejor gp de la temporada destacan asimismo las ruinas del castellum romano de can tacó situado entre montmeló y montorn s del vall s bautizado con el nombre de mons observans y es uno de los primeros asentamientos romanos de cataluña el yacimiento fue declarado bien cultural de interés nacional en fue construido en el siglo ii ac en la cumbre de un cerro desde donde se podían controlar las principales vías de comunicación sobre todo la vía augusta la edificación que ya fue excavada en los años y ha conservado el trazado de las principales dependencias que tenía se trata de un edificio de representación oficial de alguna administración romana vinculada al ejército y parece que tenía la función de praesidium un campamento militar que servía de base logística para las tropas romanas y para el control de territorios etimología la referencia más antigua que tenemos de montmeló la encontramos en la transcripción de un acta del año el acta de consagración de la iglesia de santa maria de las puel les de barcelona en relación a la donación de santa maría de montis molonis las teorías sobre la toponimia son diversas la del mont del molí encontraría fundamento en la existencia de un molino de harina concedido a guillermo durante el reinado de lúis el joven en el siglo xii la recuperación de la piedra de llinars y más recientemente la piedra termal de augustalis en el raiguer vienen a acentuar el sentido terminal de montmeló como proponía enric moreu rey el significado etimológico del nombre se explica por su procedencia de mont molló o sea colina cima o cuello de la pedrafita refiriéndose a la montañeta de las tres cruces historia montmeló se encuentra situado en medio de un importante y milenario cruce de caminos que enlazaba la via hercúlea hasta nuestros días y que comunica el sur y el levante hispánico con europa ha hecho del pueblo un lugar de paso olbigado transitado desde los tiempos más remotos se sabe de la existencia de un asentamiento neolítico antiguo fuentes de cabana de cal metge continua con el neolítico moderno sepulcro en fosa de can cucurny y llega al neolítico reciente con los restos cerámicos de la cultura de verazza campo de fútbol por otro lado se conservan cerámicas molinos de mano silos y otro elementos de la época ibérica a pesar de no tener restos de asentamiento conocidos la piedra de llinars es un menhir con señales e inscripciones muy interesantes la referencia más antigua sobre la existéncia de la piedra de llinars la encontramos en una sentencia arbitral de agosto de entre la abadesa laura y pere de montorn s sobre delimitación de los dos pueblos en el siglo ii a c con la ocupación romana se produce un cambio total la antigua via natural por el margen de los ríos se repara y en la colina de can tacó en la confluencia de los ríos mogent y congost se instala un puesto de mando militar de vigilancia y control de la ruta a medio camino de la serreta donde ahora está el número de la calle jacinto verdaguer se instala una villa romana siglo ii a c extensa y rica el nombre de la villa podría corresponder a semproniana y se conoce por uno de los vasos apolinares estaba situada a millas de seterras y millas de arragona o sea a unos km de hostalrich y a km de sabadell tanto el puesto de mando de can tacó como la villa romana de can massot fueron destruidos en el siglo i a c la villa lo fue por el fuego la fecha más probable son las guerras civiles que los romanos libraron en nuestra casa entre césar y pompeyo en el año a c la ocupación de la fértil tierra continua en el siglo iv d c época de la cual se conserva una tumba romana de la época de augusto se ha descubierto recientemente en el raiguer la piedra termal augustalis que es objeto de estudio como pieza única en cataluña el lugar sigue transitado a pesar el nuevo trazado del emperador augusto por la costa la via del interior la de la depresión prelitoral no se pierde todos los itinerarios tanto romanos como árabes o medievales nos lo confirman los destinos de montmeló estuvieron ligados durante siglos al monasterio de san pedro de las puellas de barcelona además del acta de consagración de la iglesia en el año se conservan en su archivo importantes referencias a nuestra história montmeló era conocido como los masos de sant pere el lugar donde se encuentra el circuito eran dos de estos masos la torre pardalera y el de can cabanyes datados ya en el siglo xii y que fueron desamortizados al monasterio a finales del siglo pasado el origen de la iglesia lo encontramos en las construcciones prerrománicas del siglo x de influencias carolingias y con transformaciones posteriores de los siglos xi i xii actualmente solo queda de esta primitiva iglesia románica el ábside semicircular el muro de la fachada actual y parte del campanario montmeló fue calle de barcelona en el año en el se separó y de nuevo volvió a la corona en el bajo la corona del rey fernando los hombres notables de montmeló pidieron ciertos privilegios al rey un resumen de estos los conocemos por el libro de llevador de la parroquia y por los documentos del archivo de sant pere la recuperación del manuscrito de joseph fransí nos ha revelado interesantes noticias sobre montmeló de los siglos xv xvi y xvii la construcción de la moderna n barcelona vich en el año supone para montmeló un gran atraso ya que queda definitivamente al margen de estas vías de comunicación históricas la construcción del ferrocarril el puente sobre el besós y la instalación de la fábrica cucurny son el comienzo de un proceso de industrialización y de crecimiento económico y demográfico que tiene su punto álgido en los años sesenta la puesta en funcionamiento en el año del circuito ha dado a conocer el nombre de montmeló en los últimos veinte años al lado de este crecimiento hemos de añadir el sociocultural deportivo y urbanístico en el pueblo proliferan los equipamientos comunitarios piscinas biblioteca ludoteca centro de salud casal de

es,el silfio del griego o laserpicio en latín es una planta desaparecida desde principios de nuestra era semejante a la asafétida muy valorada en la antig edad en la zona mediterránea por su exudado resinoso laser usado por sus propiedades como medicamento y condimento gastronómico descripción de la planta en la actualidad la planta se cree desaparecida si bien han sido propuestas algunas especies modernas como dicha planta o parientes muy próximos de esta por las descripciones imágenes conservadas y similitudes descritas se la considera generalmente como un miembro del género ferula a la que pertenece la asafétida que ha sido propuesta como la posible identidad del laserpicio ya que estrabón usa el término indistintamente con ambas plantas se sabe que la asafétida era usada como sustituta de inferior calidad pero se ignora si era un sucedáneo o una variedad de la misma planta de menor calidad o elaboración menos cuidadosa según plinio el viejo que no llegó a conocer el laserpicio la planta era silvestre e imposible de cultivar con fuertes y abundantes raíces y tallo similar al de la asafétida y de grosor parecido las hojas llamadas maspetum eran parecidas al perejil y la planta las mudaba cada año otros autores mencionados por plinio describen la planta con raíz de más de un codo de longitud y que mostraba una tuberosidad sobre la superficie de la tierra sobre la que se alzaba el tallo llamado magidaris del que brotaban hojas doradas que se caían durante el ascenso de la estrella del can canícula cuando el viento del sur se hace dominante según estos autores la planta se reproducía también a partir de estas hojas caídas no sólo de las semillas el nombre latino de la planta es laserpicium de ella se extraía el laser que era la resina aromática que exudaba la planta el laser se extraía tanto de la raíz como del tallo recibiendo estos jugos los nombres de rizias y caulias respectivamente siendo el último de peor calidad y con tendencia a estropearse este fluido se vertía en recipientes sobre una capa de salvado y se dejaba madurar agitándolo de cuando en cuando para evitar su putrefacción se sabía cuando había madurado por el cambio de color y la desaparición de la humedad usos la planta era cotizada tanto por sus propiedades medicinales como culinarias como condimento alimenticio es mencionado en las recetas de apicio en de re coquinaria como medicamento se le atribuían numerosas cualidades plinio menciona usos para el dolor de garganta tos fiebre indigestión y verrugas entre otras al parecer uno de sus principales usos era como contraceptivo o abortivo y plinio le atribuye específicamente utilidad para provocar la menstruación esto es verosímil ya que muchas plantas de la familia presentan propiedades estrogénicas y abortivas plinio menciona que los habitantes de cirenaica consumían el tallo de la planta tanto asado como cocido lo cual tenía efectos purgantes y purificadores del organismo extinción hacia el año el laser había desaparecido de cirene plinio narra que una única planta fue hallada en su época la cual fue enviada a nerón como obsequio un único tallo enviado a nerón es todo lo que ha sido hallado en cirenaica en la memoria de nuestra generación desde entonces no ha sido importado otro laser que aquel de persia media y armenia donde crece en abundancia aunque muy inferior al de cirenaica y además es adulterado con goma sacopenio o alubias molidas las causas de la extinción se desconocen pero se piensa que se debió principalmente a la sobreexplotación debido a su alto valor y al incremento de la demanda unida a los cambios climáticos en el norte de áfrica que se fue volviendo progresivamente más árido desde la antig edad remota la planta crecía en una franja de tierra muy estrecha en la costa flanqueada por el desierto además la planta sólo se recolectaba en estado salvaje ya que teofrasto afirmaba que no era posible cultivarla otro hecho que pudo influir fue el excesivo pastoreo en zonas donde crecía la planta unido al hecho de que la carne del ganado que la consumía adquiría un sabor agradable según plinio diversas expediciones botánicas han tenido lugar a lo largo de la historia con la finalidad de localizar la planta en el norte de áfrica sin éxito hasta la fecha testimonios históricos el silfio está documentado desde tiempos muy antiguos y su importancia para los pueblos que lo usaron queda atestiguada por el hecho de que tanto la escritura egipcia como la minoica poseían ideogramas específicos para denominar a esta planta su explotación se concentraba en la provincia cirenaica en el noreste de la actual libia y su comercio era tan importante para la ciudad de cirene que la imagen de la planta se conserva en la mayoría de monedas acuñadas en esta ciudad una de las primeras menciones es de heródoto que la menciona en el libro iv de su historia diciendo que se produce entre la isla de platea hasta la boca del sirte posteriormente hacia el ac la menciona teofrasto en su historia de las plantas y posteriormente es descrita por plinio el viejo en su historia natural hacia mediados del siglo i cuando la planta ya había prácticamente desaparecido en ella afirma que la planta valía su peso en plata el laserpicio al que los griegos llaman silfion originario de cirenaica cuyo jugo es llamado laser es excelente para uso medicinal y es pesado en denarios de plata esto lleva a pensar que tal vez el silfio fuera efectivamente una variedad de asafétida la cual se siguió exportando de las regiones mencionadas por plinio el silfio de partia en la zona sudoriental del mar caspio se consideraba el de mejor calidad tras el de cirene el obispo sinesio de cirene la menciona hacia el año diciendo que el silfio de su ciudad es una doble bendición aunque se ignora si se refiere a la planta desaparecida la existencia del silfio es recogida en herbarios y recetarios de épocas muy posteriores a su desaparición como la de un tal vinindarius en un brevis pimentorum que in domo esse debeant o resumen de condimentos que debe haber en una casa de época carolingia s viii si bien podría deberse una confusión con otra especia tal vez extraída de escritos más antiguos simbolismo plinio recoge el origen legendario del silfio mencionando a autores griegos según esta leyenda el laserpicio nació por vez primera en las cercanías del jardín de las hespérides y el golfo de sidra tras un diluvio negro como la pez esto sucedió siete años antes de la fundación de cirene ac según otras fuentes su origen se debe a aristeo también descubridor de la miel hijo de apolo y cirene en heráldica se conserva en italia el silfio d oro reciso di cirenaica una planta estilizada que fue el emblema de las unidades italianas que

es,el pan del latín panis es un alimento básico que forma parte de la dieta tradicional en europa medio oriente india américa y oceanía se suele preparar mediante el horneado de una masa elaborada fundamentalmente con harina de cereales sal y agua la mezcla en la mayoría de las ocasiones suele contener levaduras para que fermente la masa y sea más esponjosa y tierna el cereal más utilizado para la elaboración del pan es la harina de trigo también se utiliza el centeno la cebada el maíz y el arroz existen muchos tipos de pan que pueden contener otros ingredientes como grasas de diferentes tipos tocino de cerdo o de vaca mantequilla aceite de oliva huevos azúcar especias frutas frutas secas como por ejemplo pasas verduras como cebollas o semillas diversas la adición de la levadura provoca la fermentación de la masa antes del horneado y como consecuencia le proporciona un volumen y una esponjosidad debido a la producción de pequeñas burbujas de dióxido de carbono co que se quedan inmersas entre la masa húmeda de la harina al pan elaborado sin el empleo de levadura se le llama pan ácimo y debido a esa falta de levadura carece de la esponjosidad típica de los panes hinchados o levados es muy posible que las elaboraciones más primitivas de pan no llevaran levadura y la harina consistiese en granos toscamente molidos mezclados con agua que se dejaban secar al sol o que acababan entre las cenizas de un fuego los panes planos muy populares en algunas culturas es muy posible que sean los más antiguos una variante del pan con denominación propia son las galletas y los pasteles que poseen diferentes masas azucaradas es muy posible que surgieran del conocimiento panadero como una necesidad de hacer panes más portables y nutritivos a la masa se le pueden dar diferentes formas debido al empleo de diversos moldes y técnicas de amasado de esta forma existen las barras las trenzas los aros etcétera el pan ha sido tan importante en la alimentación humana que se considera como sinónimo de alimento en muchas culturas asimismo participa en muchos rituales religiosos y sociales como por ejemplo el matzoh en la pascua judía la hostia en la eucaristía cristiana y el rito de bienvenida de los pueblos eslavos que involucra el pan y la sal cita requerida antiguamente en las zonas rurales el pan era elaborado en los núcleos familiares y poco a poco el establecimiento para dispensar el pan la panadería ha ido cobrando importancia en las zonas urbanas hoy en día existen electrodomésticos específicos con los que se puede elaborar pan de forma muy sencilla por ejemplo con una máquina panificadora en la actualidad el pan es uno de los alimentos básicos que puede encontrarse en casi cualquier tienda de alimentación y grandes superficies su valor hace que se puedan calcular índices económicos de referencia como el índice de precios al consumo ipc empleado para determinar la evolución del costo de vida en las naciones el pan de mejor calidad desde el punto de vista funcional no nutricional se obtiene con una variedad de trigo moderno el triticum aestivum que es la más extensamente cultivada en el mundo del total de la producción mundial de trigo los criterios actuales para la selección del trigo no tienen en cuenta su valor nutricional sino sus cualidades funcionales para facilitar la preparación de pan y otros alimentos procesados razón por la cual se emplean variedades con alto contenido en gluten que tiene propiedades viscoelásticas únicas el gluten es particularmente deficiente en el aminoácido esencial lisina por lo que cuanto mayor es la proporción de gluten peor es la calidad de las proteínas del trigo y su valor nutricional el trigo moderno presenta una mayor capacidad citotóxica e inmunogénica debido a su alto contenido de gluten del total de las proteínas el gluten es responsable del desarrollo de los denominados trastornos relacionados con el gluten que afectan a un porcentaje creciente de la población e incluyen la enfermedad celíaca la sensibilidad al gluten no celíaca la dermatitis herpetiforme la ataxia por gluten y la alergia al trigo historia el pan fue el alimento básico de la humanidad desde la prehistoria algunos autores se imaginan que los inicios del pan podría haber sido una masa de granos semi molidos y ligeramente humedecida que podría haberse cocido al sol sobre una piedra caliente o simplemente haberse dejado abandonada junto a un fuego o fuente de calor diversa la evolución histórica del pan se fundamenta en tres vías posibles por un lado la mejora y evolución en los elementos mecánicos que pulverizan los granos los molinos etc por otro la mejora en los microorganismos que pueblan la levadura y finalmente la evolución de los hornos y los elementos que proporcionan focos de calor hornos probablemente los primeros panes estarían hechos con harinas de bellotas o de hayucos los arqueólogos han excavado y encontrado fragmentos de pan ácimo denominado también pan cenzeño en los yacimientos de los poblados cercanos a los lagos suizos se sabe que los egipcios elaboraban pan desde hace mucho tiempo y de ellos datan también las primeras evidencias arqueológicas de la utilización de la levadura en el pan así como el empleo de hornos se cree que descubrieron la fermentación por casualidad el pan para los egipcios era tan importante que se consideraba como una moneda para pagar los jornales en roma ya en la república había hornos públicos para los legionarios romanos el pan era un alimento habitual y era corriente que su dieta fuese en gran medida aceitunas y pan se les entregaba tres libras de trigo al día que trituraban en un molinillo de mano compartido por un grupo limitado de soldados de la harina se hacía el bucellatum pan con forma de anillo muy similar al actual bagel y se metía en el horno para hacer pan en algunas regiones que no formaban parte del imperio como las actuales alemania o suecia algunos habitantes que habían combatido en el ejército romano adoptaban el consumo de pan y de aquí se extendía a sectores de la población su nombre proviene del latín pannus lo que significa masa blanca este gran consumo de pan durante el imperio romano implicó la gran importancia que tuvo el cultivo y comercio del trigo con la caída del imperio romano se produjo un desabastecimiento de trigo en casi toda europa que ya se había acostumbrado de manera masiva a su consumo las exportaciones hacia el norte desaparecieron por completo prueba de la amplia difusión del pan en esa época es la palabra inglesa lady que significa en inglés antiguo la persona que amasa el pan en escandinavia ante la escasez de trigo la población tuvo que acostumbrarse a elaborar panes de centeno y de cebada siendo corriente que se le añadiese a la masa corteza de pino molida en la edad media empiezan a elaborarse distintos tipos de pan ante la escasez de trigo y como consecuencia de ello comienza su comercio el pan blanco era un privilegio de los ricos y el pan negro de cebada centeno o avena era para el resto de la población se hacía a mano en el propio hogar o en hornos públicos la ampliación progresiva del sistema alimentario introdujo cambios en los hábitos dietéticos el pan dejó de ser el elemento básico del régimen del conjunto de la población una mayor variedad de productos que permitía un mejor equilibrio en la alimentación fortaleció la robustez y la talla de los individuos en la elaboración del pan empezó a emplearse algún tipo de maquinaria una de las elaboraciones más típicas era el sop pan remojado en un líquido el pan fue sufriendo mejoras en su molienda su horneado y poco a poco fue de un producto elaborado artesanalmente a un producto industrial al que se le añaden diversos aditivos en la actualidad la maquinaria facilita en gran medida el trabajo haciendo que el pan carezca de penosas tareas se emplean amasadoras hornos automáticos transportadoras enfriadoras cortadoras y hasta máquinas para envolver a finales del siglo xx se popularizaron los panes integrales o negros ingredientes del pan los ingredientes básicos y necesarios para la elaboración del pan son solo dos harina y agua la sal es un componente opcional que se emplea para dar sabor y fortalecer la masa en algunos lugares no se emplea ni siquiera en la elaboración del pan los famosos por sus características son los panes elaborados en la toscana italia según el tipo de pan que se trate se puede incluir como cuarto ingrediente la levadura las culturas las tradiciones y las características culinarias de las regiones inducen diversas variantes respecto a los ingredientes casi siempre la elaboración del pan de una forma determinada y proporciona un carácter propio y característico a una región o a una gastronomía harina la harina es el principal ingrediente del pan consta básicamente de un cereal o una mezcla de ellos que ha sido molido finamente hasta llegar a una textura en forma de polvo por regla general es solo el endosperma del cereal dependiendo del uso final que se quiera dar a la harina pastas panadería repostería se suele moler con mayor o menor intensidad hasta lograr un polvo de una fineza extrema se suele comercializar en paquetes que rondan el kilogramo el embalaje se suele presentar en papel o cartón las harinas comercializadas en la actualidad suelen llevar una mezcla de diversos tipos de cereal molidos y por regla general suelen estar enriquecidas para comprender el proceso de panificación conviene entender la harina como un conjunto de dos sustancias gluten corresponden al conjunto de proteínas insolubles en agua procedentes de los cereales molidos son las responsables de proporcionar a la masa un aspecto compacto similar al del chicle el gluten es también el responsable de atrapar el dióxido de carbono liberado durante la fermentación y provocar el hinchamiento de la masa cuando estas proteínas se encuentran en un medio seco son inertes pero en medios acuosos las cadenas de aminoácidos empiezan a alinearse formando redes de proteínas que son las que dan la textura final a la masa el gluten se compone principalmente de glutenina proporciona resistencia y fortaleza y la gliadina es la que proporciona la cualidad pegajosa a la masa el gluten por sí mismo no aporta aroma al pan el contenido de gluten en una harina por sí solo no es definidor de la cualidad de una harina dos harinas con el mismo contenido de gluten se comportan de formas muy diferentes almidón el almidón representa aproximadamente el de peso de la harina y posee como funcionalidad la energía que necesitará la futura planta para poder crecer el almidón se presenta en forma de gránulos que poseen dos moléculas de almidón distintas la amilosa y la amilopectina estas dos moléculas se organizan en los gránulos con una estructura cuasi cristalina que absorbe poca agua los almidones cumplen la misión de repartir la humedad de forma homogénea durante el amasado y de proporcionar una estructura semi sólida a la masa la harina junto con los lípidos existentes en los granos son los que proporcionan los olores característicos del pan el porcentaje de gluten define a veces los tipos de harina por ejemplo las harinas de fuerza son aquellas que poseen un alto contenido de gluten puede superar el de peso total es por esta razón que un alto contenido de gluten hace que el amasado requiera más fuerza ya que la masa de estas harinas es más resistente al estirado manual al contrario las harinas débiles son aquellas con un contenido bajo en gluten que proporcionan masas más fáciles de manipular algunas variedades de cereales contienen más gluten que otras por ejemplo la harina de trigo es rica en gluten y por ello importante para crear una textura esponjosa por el contrario las harinas de cebada o de avena poseen menos gluten y menos capacidad de retener el co resultando masas menos esponjosas es corriente también encontrar mezclas de harinas de trigo con otros cereales pobres de gluten incluso es habitual que se mezclen harinas de trigo de diferentes procedencias y riqueza en gluten para obtener harinas muy ricas destinadas a panes específicos existen clasificaciones de harina especiales que contienen indicaciones de la pureza y de la cantidad de endosperma así como el contenido en cenizas las clasificaciones más reconocidas internacionalmente son la francesa y la estadounidense la harina posee también otras substancias en un porcentaje en peso inferior al como puede ser una proporción diminuta de lípidos su misión es favorecer las uniones de las proteínas del gluten gliadina y glutenina contiene también otros hidratos de carbono aparte del almidón y algunas enzimas las amilasas proteasas actúan sobre las proteínas del gluten transformándolas en cadenas más cortas la sal inhibe la acción de esta enzima y las lipasas agua el agua tiene como misión activar las proteínas de la harina para que la masa adquiera textura blanda y moldeable posee además la capacidad disolvente acuoso de las substancias añadidas a la masa siendo además necesaria para la marcha de la fermentación la composición química del agua empleada afecta a las cualidades del pan la proporción de agua empleada en la elaboración de la masa influencia la consistencia final suele aplicarse agua de tal forma que suponga un del volumen total de la masa o lo que es lo mismo un del peso de la harina o la harina es y veces el peso de agua si se pone un contenido acuoso inferior al la masa es menos extensible y más densa no obstante la cantidad de agua que puede absorber una harina depende del tipo de cereal empleado en su elaboración y de la composición de proteínas por ejemplo las harinas de alto contenido proteico absorben más agua no obstante el tipo de pan puede influenciar también la proporción final de agua en la masa y puede acabar siendo un tema de preferencia del propio panadero que elabora el pan los panaderos usan un sistema de porcentajes denominado tasa de hidratación también conocido como porcentaje de panadero en el que el peso de la harina representa un porcentaje de y el resto de los ingredientes se miden como porcentajes sobre la harina el agua puede representar desde un cincuenta por ciento en panes ligeros hasta un setenta por ciento en panes más artesanos algunos panaderos pueden llegar al ochenta por ciento de agua la calidad y composición de las aguas influyen en la formación de la masa por ejemplo se sabe que las aguas con un carácter ácido endurecen la red de gluten mientras que las alcalinas suavizan la masa esta es la razón por la que a veces se emplean aguas minerales o filtradas en la elaboración de la masa para evitar que estas variables afecten negativamente a la masa final matando o inhibiendo por ejemplo las levaduras las aguas fluoradas pueden llegar a detener la fermentación el medio líquido de la mezcla puede también contener otras substancias líquidas con una función similar a la del agua como puede ser la leche el suero de mantequilla bebidas alcohólicas como puede ser el vino o la cerveza o whisky de malta e incluso mezclas avinagradas diversas algunas investigaciones muestran que el proceso de hidratación de la masa tras su mezcla con el agua puede llevar entre y minutos tiempo que es necesario para reposar la masa y dejar que se impregne por completo conviene retrasar la adición de levadura hasta que la masa se haya hidratado bien tras este periodo de reposo la dureza del agua puede influir en la elaboración del pan debido a que poseen sales minerales que favorecen la fermentación con las levaduras por regla general las aguas de dureza media son preferibles para la elaboración del pan si es el agua dura la masa tendrá dificultad para llegar a su punto de resistencia sal la sal es un ingrediente opcional en algunos panes la misión de la sal es por una parte la de reforzar los sabores y aromas del propio pan y por otra parte afectar a la textura final de la masa pueden alcanzar hasta un del peso total de la harina los panes tradicionales no suelen llevar sal sin embargo algunas masas como los cruasanes o los brioche poseen grandes cantidades por encima del con el objeto de reforzar y balancear el sabor de la mantequilla se suelen emplear en la elaboración de panes sales marinas a ser posible con poco grado de refinamiento y que se mezclan en las primeras fases de amasamiento de la harina sea como sea la mayoría de las recetas que añaden la sal hablan del empleo de sales no refinadas como pueden ser la sal negra la sal ahumada etcétera la sal contribuye de una forma indirecta a la formación del color marrón de la corteza del pan debido a que retarda la fermentación y esto genera un exceso de azúcares que favorecen durante el horneado la formación de estos colores dorados de la corteza la sal tiene además un ligero efecto fungicida su presencia en el pan permite alargar su vida comestible en algunos casos se aconseja añadir la sal tras el completo fermentado del pan para evitar la muerte o inhibición de las levaduras proceso conocido como autolisis en el método de autolisis la sal y la levadura se añaden tras un reposo de entre y minutos algunos autores opinan que la sal retrasa el efecto de la levadura prolongando de esta forma la fermentación las levaduras buscan los azúcares de la harina y la sal hace más difícil el trabajo fermentativo la sal se emplea a veces como un elemento decorativo y suele ubicarse en forma de gruesos granos en la superficie de la corteza como es en el caso de los pretzel el consumo de sal que va unido al riesgo de padecer hipertensión arterial ha llevado a las autoridades sanitarias de españa y de otros países europeos como reino unido francia y alemania a establecer acuerdos con distintas asociaciones de fabricantes de pan para limitar el contenido de sal en el pan de esta manera en los últimos cuatro años en españa el contenido de sal se ha reducido desde los gramos por kilo de harina que tenía en hasta que tiene en el lo que significa un descenso del levadura la levadura es un conjunto de microorganismos unicelulares que tienen por objeto alimentarse del almidón y de los azúcares existentes en la harina las levaduras forman parte de la familia de los hongos este proceso metabólico da lugar a la fermentación alcohólica cuyo resultado es etanol cuya fórmula química es ch ch oh dióxido de carbono co en forma de gas el gas liberado hace que la masa del pan se hinche aumentando de volumen el alcohol etílico se evapora durante el horneado del pan debido a las temperaturas alcanzadas en su interior a pesar de haber empleado las levaduras en la fermentación del pan desde hace ya casi más de años fueron tan solo comprendidas hasta el advenimiento de las investigaciones realizadas por louis pasteur que dieron luz a la explicación científica de la fermentación como un proceso biológico la clave del empleo de las levaduras es la generación gaseosa que hincha la masa mezcla de harina y agua se sabe que el proceso de fermentación es altamente dependiente de la temperatura y que se produce a su máxima velocidad a los oc las levaduras se incorporan durante las primeras etapas de mezcla entre la harina y el agua hoy en día se conocen casi más de especies diferentes denominadas como levaduras algunas de ellas son responsables de causar infecciones otras levaduras contribuyen a la degeneración y putrefacción de los alimentos de todas ellas una especie en particular es la responsable de causar la fermentación del pan se trata de la saccharomyces cerevisiae esta levadura es igualmente la causante de la fermentación del vino y de la cerveza el metabolismo de la levadura puede expresarse en forma de reacción química sencilla de la siguiente forma c h o c h oh co lo que significa una molécula de glucosa que puede ser el almidón de la harina mediante la acción del metabolismo de las levaduras acaba en dos moléculas de etanol y dos de dióxido de carbono gas el gas queda atrapado en la red de la gluteina y aumenta el volumen de la masa disminuyendo su densidad bajo la denominación de levaduras podemos encontrarnos tres tipos siempre del tipo s cerevisiae en los establecimientos levadura seca se obtiene de los tanques de fermentación y posteriormente se desecan para detener los procesos metabólicos de las levaduras las levaduras secas se reactivan cuando son introducidas en un medio acuoso templado c c de nuevo antes de ser mezcladas en la masa en este caso se denominan levaduras activas existen levaduras denominadas como instantáneas que no necesitan ser prehidratadas y que se mezclan con la harina y el agua al mismo tiempo por regla general proporcionan dióxido de carbono de forma más vigorosa que las levaduras activas los panaderos profesionales emplean cada vez más este tipo de levaduras secas instantáneas debido la conveniencia en la rapidez de su trabajo así como su larga vida media levadura fresca obtenida inmediatamente de una fermentación y posteriormente refrigerada en forma de cubos de gramos aproximadamente con textura de pasta comprimida que poseen una vida útil de escasas semanas los elaboradores de pan suelen preferir este tipo de levadura el problema es que posee una vida media inferior a otras levaduras la levadura fresca es similar a la levadura seca la única consideración es que debe emplearse el doble por ejemplo si una receta de pan indica gramos de levadura seca en ese caso se empleará el doble de levadura fresca es decir g levadura química se trata de compuestos químicos capaces de generar gases generalmente dióxido de carbono tal y como lo haría una levadura en algunos casos el componente alcalino denominado bicarbonato de sodio nahco denominado en inglés como baking soda mezclado con un medio ácido como puede ser zumo de limón o de frutas chocolate etcétera levaduras naturales son aquellas presentes en el propio cereal en la atmósfera etcétera estas levaduras se caracterizan por un lento proceso de fermentación proporcionan menos dióxido de carbono pero proporcionan un sabor clásico al pan realizado con ellas la cantidad de levadura que emplea el panadero puede variar dependiendo del tipo de masa que se quiera elaborar y puede oscilar entre el del peso de la harina en el caso de levaduras secas se divide entre dos la cantidad total empleada a veces se suele incluir prefermentadores en inglés se denomina poolish a la harina con el objeto de mejorar los efectos de las levaduras en la harinas y para ello se emplean diversos métodos como puede ser el fermento de masa ácida que se trata de un cultivo de las levaduras existentes en el aire para que se cultiven en la harina y acaben formando un fermento denominado a veces también como masa madre la formación de este fermento genera dióxido de carbono co y ácido láctico h c ch oh cooh las especies de levaduras empleadas en este tipo de levaduras madre es el lactobacillus plantarum l delbrueckii l sanfrancisco tradicionalmente las levaduras se incorporaban a la masa utilizando los restos de la masa del pan elaborado durante el día anterior en lo que se denominaba masa madre otras prefermentaciones populares en el área mediterránea suelen ser el biga italiano otros ingredientes se suelen añadir otros ingredientes a los anteriormente mencionados bien con el objeto de mejorar la fermentación como puede ser el caso del azúcar o bien con el objeto de mejorar el sabor para eso se añaden en algunos lugares especias diversas pan especiado es frecuente que se le añadan otros elementos como grasas mantequilla tocino de cerdo semillas diversas pipas de girasol sésamo etc frutas banana cebollas leche en polvo etcétera también se suele añadir huevo bien sea la yema o la clara en algunos casos resulta interesante que se le añadan los granos del cereal ligeramente molidos e incluso malteados añade enzimas alfa amilasas que favorecen el fermentado de la masa se suelen añadir en algunas zonas del mediterráneo unas aceitunas molidas en algunos casos es posible incluir algún embutido o incluso fiambre picado como puede ser chorizo como en el caso del bollo preñao o jamón pudiendo a llegar a poner en algunas culturas hasta pescado como en el caso del kalakukko esta forma de rellenar el pan da lugar a una familia muy amplia de alimentos denominado dumplings empanadas hogazas el dampfnudel el calzone los panes de elaboración industrial poseen cantidades apreciables de leche o incluso la adición de leche en polvo con el objetivo de incrementar el contenido de lisina en el pan en algunos casos el pan es considerado desde la industria como un alimento funcional y se le añaden vitaminas suele denominarse a este tipo como pan enriquecido el contenido de azúcar es en el caso del pan de molde muy acusado algunos ingredientes de la panadería industrial suelen ser enzimas diversos como la amilasa que se añade para favorecer la fermentación y que el pan se haga de forma más homogénea una de las aplicaciones más frecuentes de la industria bioquímica en el uso de enzimas es la panadería algunos enzimas como la fitasa fúngica se añaden al pan con el objetivo de reducir el contenido de ácido fítico el cual se considera una sustancia antinutritiva por disminuir la biodisponibilidad de minerales tales como calcio zinc magnesio hierro y fósforo se suele incluir en las harinas la amilasa ya que cambia las propiedades químicas degrada los azúcares complejos del pan en azúcares más sencillos en la fermentación y físicas en la miga la hace más suave se emplea la proteasa lipoxidasas el empleo de diversos productos que se mezclan con la harina y que mejoran los rendimientos de producción del pan se denominan mejoradores para pan y se llevan empleando en la industria panadera desde los años otros de los aditivos empleados son los antioxidantes con el objeto de mantener las propiedades del pan lo más estables posibles uno de los más polémicos empleados son el hidroxibutilanisol bha y el hidroxibutiltolueno bht se suele añadir a la masa ácido ascórbico vitamina c con el objeto de reforzar las propiedades físicas del pan útil en especial en grandes piezas al mismo tiempo que acelerar su maduración el ácido ascórbico se elimina por completo durante el horneado la lecitina suele añadírsele por ser un emulsificante el propionato cálcico como fungicida evitando la aparición de hongos elaboración del pan la elaboración del pan es un conjunto de varios procesos en cadena comienza con los ingredientes en sus proporciones justas y las herramientas para su elaboración dispuestas para realizar las operaciones mise en place y acaba con el pan listo para ser servido dependiendo de los panaderos se añaden más o menos procesos a la elaboración aunque básicamente hay cuatro mezcla de la harina con el agua así como otros ingredientes proceso de trabajar la masa reposo para hacer elevar la masa solo si se incluyó levadura a este proceso se le denomina a veces como leudado horneado en el que simplemente se somete durante un período la masa a una fuente de calor para que se cocine enfriado tras el horneado se deja reposar el pan hasta que alcance la temperatura ambiente cada paso del proceso permite tomar decisiones acerca de la textura y sabor final que se quiera dar al pan en la industria panadera hodierna existen procesos estandarizados desde la década de tal y como el proceso de panificación chorleywood abreviadamente cbp del inglés chorleywood bread process que permite elaborar pan industrial a gran rapidez debido a las veloces fermentaciones que realiza del orden de los minutos otro paso industrial es el denominado proceso de esponja masa muy empleado en la elaboración industrial de los panes de molde por regla general los libros que mencionan los procesos de panificación si requieren precisión suelen hablar de las cantidades en unidades de peso no de volumen formación de la masa la formación de la masa se compone de dos subprocesos la mezcla y el trabajado amasado la masa comienza a formarse justo en el instante cuando se produce mezcla de la harina con el agua en este momento el medio acuoso permite que aparezcan algunas reacciones químicas que transforman la mezcla en una masa casi fibrosa esto es debido a las proteínas de la harina gluten que empiezan a alinearse en cientos de cadenas al realizarse la mezcla entre la harina y el agua formándose la primera masa antes de ser trabajada algunos panaderos opinan que es mejor dejar reposar aproximadamente durante minutos con el objeto de permitir que la mezcla se haga homogénea y se hidrate por completo permite actuar a las moléculas de glutenina y de gliadina en la harina la elaboración de la masa se puede hacer a mano o mediante el empleo de un mezclador o incluso de un robot de cocina estos últimos tienen la ventaja de exponer la masa durante poco tiempo al oxígeno de la atmósfera algunos panaderos mencionan la posibilidad de airear la harina antes de ser mezclada para que pueda favorecer la acción del amasado durante la fase de mezclas algunas enzimas lipooxigenasa y polifenol oxidasa actúan en la destrucción de los carotenoides al acto de trabajar la masa se denomina amasar en otros idiomas este verbo es más específico de la masa de harina como puede ser kneading knead en inglés que viene a significar algo así como comprimir en una bola en francés se denomina pétrissage se denomina amasado a la mezcla adecuada de los ingredientes que supone además una incorporación de aire es necesario un aporte de energía trabajo fuerza de amasado que se absorbe durante la formación del gluten provocando un incremento de la t debido a la liberación de energía por orientación de la red de gluten y por la fuerza de rozamiento se pueden dar dos tipos de amasado un amasado manual en el cual el aporte de energía es lento y por tanto la temperatura se eleva poco a poco un amasado mecánico donde el aporte de energía es rápido y el aumento de temperatura va en función de la velocidad con la que trabaje la máquina amasadora la absorción liberación de energía depende del contenido proteico de la harina que también determina la cantidad de agua necesaria la masa se trabaja de forma física haciendo primero que se estire con las manos para luego doblarse sobre sí misma comprimirse se evita la formación de burbujas de aire y volver a estirar para volver a doblar y a comprimir repitiendo el proceso varias veces procediendo de esta forma se favorece el alineamiento de las moléculas de gluten haciendo que se fortalezca poco a poco la masa y permita capturar mejor los gases de la fermentación esta operación de amasamiento hace que la masa vaya adquiriendo progresivamente fortaleza y sea cada vez más difícil de manipular las masas con mayor contenido de gluten requieren mayor fuerza en su amasado y es por eso por lo que se denominan masas de fuerza que la masa sea sobre trabajada es un problema en la panadería industrial debido al empleo de máquinas especiales para ello amasadoras en ocasiones muy raras ocurre este fenómeno cuando se trabaja la masa a mano la operación de amasado se suele realizar en una superficie aceitada para favorecer el manejo y evitar que la masa pegajosa se adhiera a la superficie la adición de otros elementos a la masa como pueda ser mantequilla aceite huevos etc por regla general lo que hace es retrasar el desarrollo de la masa debido al contenido de lípidos esta es la razón por la que la elaboración de masas como la del brioche que poseen desde un hasta un de mantequilla en relación con la harina suelen ser completamente mezcladas antes de que se le añada el azúcar y la mantequilla fenómenos principales durante el amasado formación del gluten gliadina y glutenina se hidratan del agua es captada por las proteínas interaccionan entre si y forman la red del gluten activación de las enzimas se activan al hidratarse entre ellas las amilasas que actúan rompiendo el almidón formando azúcares hidratación del almidón capta el del agua se hincha abriendo su estructura y queda listo para la actuación de las enzimas y para la gelatinización solubilización de los componentes azúcares sales aminoácidos ácidos formándose una solución coloidal incorporación de aire necesario para la formación del gluten oxido reducción para la multiplicación de las levaduras para esponjar el gluten fermentación y reposo la fermentación del pan ocurre en diversas etapas la denominada fermentación primaria empieza a ocurrir justamente tras el amasado y se suele dejar la masa en forma de bola metida en un recipiente para que repose a una temperatura adecuada durante esta espera la masa suele adquirir mayor tamaño debido a que la levadura si se ha incluido libera dióxido de carbono co durante su etapa de metabolismo se dice en este caso que la masa fermenta la masa parece que se va inflando a medida que avanza el tiempo de reposo la temperatura de la masa durante esta fase del proceso es muy importante debido a que la actividad metabólica de las levaduras es máxima a los c pero de la misma forma a esta temperatura se produce co a mayor ritmo pero al mismo tiempo también malos olores es por esta razón por la que la mayoría de los libros de panadería sugieren emplear temperaturas inferiores rondando los c lo que supone un reposo de aproximadamente dos horas la temperatura gobierna este proceso de fermentación a mayor temperatura menor tiempo de reposo a veces algunos panaderos desean que las levaduras actúen durante el mayor tiempo que sea posible ya que este periodo dilatado con un mayor aroma y sabor al pan en algunos casos se hace uso de frigorífico el final de la fermentación primaria lo indica el volumen de la masa hinchada se menciona a veces que debe doblar el volumen la red de gluten se estira hasta llegar a un límite que no puede sobrepasar una de las pruebas más populares para comprobar que se ha llegado al límite es presionar la masa con un dedo y se comprueba que la marca permanece entonces se deduce que el gluten se ha estirado hasta su límite a veces se emplea en el primer reposo una cesta de mimbre denominada banneton en algunos casos se comprueba que una larga fermentación y por lo tanto reposo hace que el resultado final del pan sea agradable es por esta razón por la que los panaderos de viena desde la década de empezaron a experimentar con la posibilidad de dividir los procesos en dos turnos de trabajo por el día mezclaban amasaban y moldeaban la masa por la mañana temprano hacían el horneado para poder hacer esto metían los panes moldeados en refrigeradores con el objeto de retrasar la fermentación y poder hacer el horneado por la mañana las levaduras se toman casi diez veces más tiempo en fermentar si están el refrigerador esta práctica de retardo es muy habitual hoy en día tras el reposo se produce una segunda fermentación antes de que esta ocurra se le suele dar a la masa su forma definitiva barra trenza etcétera hay panaderos que vuelven a dar un ligero amasado antes de proporcionar la forma definitiva con el objetivo de elongar las burbujas de gas en la masa esta segunda fermentación es previa al horneado a veces se introducen cortes con un cuchillo en la superficie de la masa para que queden formas agradables a la vista al mismo tiempo que sea más fácil partir tras el horneado horneado en esta fase del proceso de elaboración del pan se suele emplear una fuente de calor que en la mayoría de los casos se trata de un horno tradicionalmente solía ser de leña y que hoy en día son de electricidad gasóil o gas además del horneado también puede cocinarse en sartén cazuela parrilla en cenizas o directamente sobre el fuego los hornos antiguos eran de arcilla piedra o ladrillo lo que permitía almacenar gran cantidad de energía calorífica la forma de operar de estos hornos era muy sencilla se introducía madera que se ponía a arder y cuando las brasas quedaban lo que permitía alcanzar una temperatura entre c y c se retiraban y se introducían las masas moldeadas de pan en las panaderías hodiernas se emplean hornos de gas o de electricidad que no sobrepasan los c la cocción estándar se realiza a temperaturas comprendidas entre y c dependiendo del tamaño del pan y el tipo de horno la duración del horneado puede oscilar entre los y minutos para los panes pequeños alcanzando más de una hora para las piezas más grandes la medida exacta se encuentra siempre en la experiencia de cada panadero los primeros minutos de la cocción suelen resecar el ambiente del horno y es esta la razón por la que suele pulverizarse agua para prevenir este resecamiento inicial algunos autores aconsejan introducir cubitos de hielo en las bandejas inferiores para que tomen su tiempo en derretirse y proporcionar vapor en el momento apropiado los hornos profesionales suelen tener la posibilidad de inyectar vapor en estas fases del horneado las diferencias de temperatura alcanzadas entre la miga interior y la corteza pueden alcanzar los c por lo que conviene asegurarse que el interior alcanza esta temperatura para poder garantizar la erradicación de los posibles organismos patógenos que hayan quedado en la masa dependiendo del tipo de pan de si se ha empleado levaduras o no la masa puede sufrir un crecimiento dentro del horno sea como sea el horneado con su elevada temperatura mata las levaduras si se hizo el pan con levadura pero la aireación que hinchó la masa tras la fermentación permanece desde el punto de vista reológico el horneado convierte una masa viscoelástica en un pan elástico la masa es un gel que en el caso de los panes fermentados retiene dióxido de carbono en su interior mientras que el pan horneado es una esponja que resulta permeable al gas el proceso de transformación ocurre a ciertas temperaturas en el interior del horno en torno a los c algunos panaderos han diseñado dispositivos para calentar la masa desde el interior y provocando un crecimiento homogéneo de la masa estos panes no poseían corteza en el horneado la temperatura crece progresivamente desde el exterior al interior el color de la corteza oscuro se debe a la reacción de maillard a veces se modula este color con aditivos los hornos ofrecen mucha variación en las diferentes culturas y puede decirse que su uso ha ido cambiando a lo largo de la historia de la elaboración del pan hoy en día se pueden ver como los hornos diseñados hace muchos siglos atrás siguen funcionando tal es así el tandoor indio el taboon en forma de cono donde se elabora el pan taboon etcétera es en el siglo xviii cuando los hornos de panadería adquieren la tecnología que les hace más productivos con la posibilidad de poder controlar la humedad durante su horneado algunos panes se hornean dos veces en un periodo de horas en lo que se denomina biscuit en el mundo anglosajón se denomina rusk o el zwieback germano el primer horneado se realiza normalmente se corta el pan en rodajas y se deja reposar durante horas para realizar un segundo horneado enfriamiento tras la cocción en el horno sobreviene directamente el enfriamiento del pan debido a que se extrae de la fuente primaria de calor y poco a poco va enfriándose debe decirse que en este proceso la capa de la corteza suele tener muy poca humedad y muy alta temperatura la corteza tiene una humedad relativa del mientras que la miga un durante el enfriamiento la humedad interior de la miga sale al exterior a través de la corteza la velocidad de pérdida de humedad dependerá en gran parte de la forma que posea el pan el desecado interior va dando firmeza al almidón no suele aconsejarse ingerir el pan cuando está recién salido del horno el proceso de enfriamiento es igualmente un proceso de maduración este proceso es más necesario incluso para aquellos panes que han necesitado de masas ácidas en su elaboración almacenamiento el almacenamiento del pan es un tema de interés para la industria panadera debido a que se trata de un producto relativamente perecedero al que se le añaden a veces ciertas sustancias químicas para que posea una vida media superior la aceptación cada vez menor de los consumidores a este tipo de actividades ha hecho que se abra en ciertas ocasiones una polémica el almacenamiento evita los cambios físicos y químicos en el pan debido a las actividades microbianas principalmente el resultado de esos cambios resulta en un cambio de las propiedades organolépticas aroma y textura que induce al consumidor a deducir que el pan no es fresco en algunas ocasiones se vende en los supermercados pan congelado que evidentemente soporta mayor tiempo de vida que un pan envasado en bolsas de plástico hoy en día se sabe que la retrogradación de los almidones del pan a formas cristalinas es una de las principales causas de la dureza del pan otros factores que afectan al ratio con el que se pone duro firmeza han sido investigados como puede ser la temperatura de almacenamiento el contenido húmedo denominado como actividad acuosa aw del pan cambios en la estructura del gluten y la migración de la humedad durante su almacenamiento los procesos que causan que el pan se ponga rancio y duro empiezan durante la fase final de enfriado es decir al salir del horno comenzando incluso antes de que el almidón se haya solidificado durante el almacenamiento la miga del pan se va poniendo cada vez más dura seca y crujiente en este proceso la corteza se va haciendo más blanda y húmeda se atribuye por regla general este proceso a un resecamiento de la miga del pan se puede decir que el proceso de envejecimiento del pan se debe principalmente a la aparición de dos sub procesos que aparecen de forma separada la rigidez causada por la transferencia de humedad desde la miga a la corteza y la rigidez intrínseca de las paredes celulares asociada a la re cristalización durante el almacenamiento durante el envejecimiento el contenido húmedo de la corteza va aumentando como resultado de la migración hacia fuera desde su interior si se envuelve el pan en una lámina anti humedad se acentúa la degradación de la corteza haciendo que la humedad de la miga no migre hacia afuera sin embargo se aconseja el embalado del pan debido a que reduce la pérdida global de humedad a la atmósfera se ha comprobado que calentar el pan a temperaturas cercanas a los c hace que se pueda revertir el proceso de dureza en el pan esto ocurre debido a que las moléculas retenidas en la estructura de los glóbulos de almidón se liberan y además los geles de las amilosas vuelven a ser tiernas de nuevo esta es la razón por la que el pan duro a veces se pone blando en el horno a temperaturas ligeras por debajo de los c se aconseja para evitar el endurecimiento del pan que si se va a consumir en uno o dos días se almacene en una panera o en una simple bolsa de papel ya que mantiene la humedad perfectamente si se va a consumir el pan en más de dos días se aconseja meterlo en una bolsa de plástico y congelarlo por completo almacenar en la nevera tan solo si se va a recalentar antes de ser ingerido como por ejemplo las tostadas comparado con otros alimentos el pan contiene poca agua y esto significa que puede ser contaminado por hongos si no es adecuadamente almacenado las especies de hongos azules que suelen atacar el pan son aspergillus y penicillium así como las especies de monilia sitophila en los panes de origen industrial se suelen añadir tras el fermentado algunos antifúngicos con el objeto de evitar la degradación por hongos y poder almacenar durante más tiempo el pan uno de los más empleados es el propionato cálcico e de fórmula ca ch ch coo al algunos de los microorganismos fúngicos más frecuentes en el pan durante esta fase son el rhizopus nigricans el penicillium expansum p stoloniferum y el aspergillus niger entre los microorganismos no fúngicos contenidos en el pan se encuentra el bacillus subtilis usos del pan el principal uso del pan es como alimentación humana y debe tenerse en cuenta que dentro de esta actividad existen innumerables posibilidades se emplea frecuentemente como acompañamiento de otros platos y es frecuente verlo en la parte central de la mesa recogido a veces en una especie de cesta apropiada para su uso generalmente cortado en rebanadas instantes antes de servirse en algunas ocasiones el pan mismo es un aperitivo tal y como es el grissini en la cocina italiana uno de los usos más comunes del pan es servirse como puede ser en la elaboración de preparaciones en las que se incluyan otros alimentos entre dos rebanadas de pan así se consigue el popular sándwich que se elabora con pan de molde incluyendo entre las rebanadas de pan diversos contenidos generalmente cárnicos así como salsas en forma de ensaladas este tipo de sándwiches puede ser servido frío o caliente generalmente elaborado en una sandwichera de la misma forma en la cocina española se tienen variantes del emparedado en panes con cortezas más duras como es el bocadillo en sus diferentes variantes ejemplos son el bocadillo de calamares y el pepito de ternera y que han llegado en la actualidad a una forma refinada de alta cocina en lo que se denomina bocadillo de autor en la cocina italiana se tiene un equivalente en el panini convertido en algunas ocasiones en parte de ciertas comidas rápidas se puede encontrar en las hamburguesas los perritos calientes los d ner kebab o los shawarma entre otros en otros casos aparece en diferentes pequeños almuerzos como pueda ser el ploughman s lunch inglés en las tapas españolas en los meze turcos o el internacional coffee break a veces se usa como untado como es el caso de las fondues mont d or chaud o en la ingesta de algunas sopas o salsas como es el caso de la salsa de pan otras variantes poseen contenidos abiertos como la pizza que han tenido en la cocina italiana un origen en un pan plano denominado focaccia pizza blanca otro ejemplo es el popular pan con tomate pa amb tom quet en catalán el cachopo de la cocina asturiana el strammer max alemán etcétera dentro de la categoría de panes abiertos en rebanadas se tienen los untados que se esparce un alimento líquido o semilíquido sobre la superficie en este caso se tiene el sardina p té los gravy etc es muy frecuente encontrar el pan en los desayunos en forma de rebanadas tostadas al fuego o en una tostadora a las que se añade unos pedazos de mermelada y mantequilla fundida de forma similar existe el mollete de desayuno andaluz el br tchen del cocina alemana el pan ya seco suele aprovecharse en cocina rallándolo consiguiendo de esta forma pan rallado que participa posteriormente rebozado en innumerables preparaciones fritas como pueden ser los alimentos empanados algunos de ellos son las croquetas el pollo frito las milanesas filetes de carne empanadas el pan rallado fundamentalmente proporciona una textura crujiente el pan rallado puede emplearse igualmente en el espesamiento de salsas de carne como pueden ser los gravys el xató así como en el de sopas frías como puede ser el salmorejo o el gazpacho el gruel como la sopas de ajo en la cocina alemana y austriaca se puede encontrar la miga del pan en forma de masas cocinadas que acompañan a ciertos guisos y que se denominan kl e en forma de cubos se puede freír en aceite y formar parte de los cro tons que se ubican en ensaladas como la césar o los famosos picatostes cubiertos de azúcar en algunas ocasiones participa en ensaladas como el caso del fattoush en los países árabes se trata de una variante panificada del tabbouleh se encuentran preparaciones de pan que forman parte de los postres como pueden ser los puddings uno de los más conocidos es el pudding de pan en las culturas anglosajonas el pan duro forma parte de los ingredientes de algunos platos de origen humilde como puede ser las sopas de ajo y las torrijas de la cocina de semana santa otro ejemplo en la cocina española que está relacionado con la matanza son las migas así como en la elaboración de algunas morcillas algunos panes se cocinan con ingredientes dentro es el caso del matnakash armenio armenio el bollo preñao de asturias españa empanadas etcétera en algunas ocasiones el pan participa como ingrediente principal en un plato como es el caso del panko de la cocina japonesa en algunas ocasiones el pan ocupa un lugar en las tradiciones familiares de una comunidad como es el caso de la cena de acción de gracias donde se suelen elaborar panes especiales con objeto de la ocasión a veces el pan se emplea en numerosos remedios caseros como un elemento quita olores al cocinar ciertas verduras como las coles para remover humedad excesiva en la cocción de alimentos como el arroz o quitar la grasa superficial de caldos de carne a veces se emplea en el paladar para aplacar la sensación pungente de los alimentos picantes ingeridos y con una función similar entre dos catas de vino para no confundir aromas también se usa a veces para retirar de forma segura los pequeños trozos de vidrio del suelo que quedan tras haberse caído un recipiente y romperse en muchos casos se emplea como alimento de animales domésticos así como de pájaros que viven en núcleos urbanos un ejemplo son las palomas en algunos casos los alimentos se emplean como substitutivo del pan es así el español pan de cádiz el pan de higos el colombiano pan de azúcar también se usa el pan en esculturas artísticas en ese caso suele llamarse masa muerta sabor del pan en los alimentos el sabor procede de un conjunto de reacciones químicas que pueden dividirse fundamentalmente en dos tipos procesos enzimáticos y no enzimáticos como puede ser la reacción de maillard el sabor del pan procede de multitud de elementos intervinientes de forma conjunta en la masa por ejemplo de la harina el gluten no proporciona ni aroma ni sabor en sí mismo mientras que el almidón junto con los lípidos proporcionan el carácter de la harina misma los almidones y lípidos en combinación con los enzimas propios de la harina y las bacterias así como las levaduras son las responsables del aroma del pan en algunos casos los propios enzimas existentes en la harina pueden generar el olor característico del pan en algunos casos el pan elaborado con masas madre poseen un sabor más apreciado que aquellos que se hacen con levaduras industriales y esta es una de las razones por las que a veces se indica en los panes de algunas panaderías la procedencia de este tipo de pre fermentación algunos autores han detectado que el sabor del pan procede de ácidos orgánicos volátiles producidos durante la fermentación esta es la razón por la cual la fermentación adecuada es la que proporciona un sabor característico al pan tipos de pan a pesar de lo reducido de los ingredientes la variedad de panes en la culinaria mundial es muy grande debido en gran parte a las variantes en los procesos de su elaboración a las tradiciones culinarias a la disponibilidad de los diferentes tipos cereales a las formas impresas a sus masas a la ausencia de uno de sus ingredientes como puede ser de la levadura a las decoraciones exteriores etcétera panes sin levadura este tipo de panes denominados a veces también como panes cenceños o ácimo se elaboran con el simple concurso de la harina y el agua es uno de los panes más antiguos que puede suponerse debido a la simplicidad de los ingredientes un ejemplo es la ley chametz de la culinaria judía en la que se evita comer panes fermentados con levaduras en especial en la pascua judía casiodoro de reina cipriano de valera biblia versión reina valera wikisource de esta forma se tienen panes como el matzoh o los panes elaborados según el pas yisroel en el norte de áfrica en la india y parte de asia se elaboran panes de esta clase con harina de trigo así como de burghul se tienen las trahanas de la cocina sefardí las tortillas de trigo de la cocina mexicana así como del sur de estados unidos las cr pes elaboradas con masas líquidas sin levadura que se hacen en la sartén a muy alta temperatura la mayoría de los panes planos se elaboran con masas sin levadura panes de masa ácida este tipo de panes se caracterizan por elaborarse con una masa ácida la acidez proviene de los cultivos bacterianos realizados en la masa madre que le proporciona un sabor característico final al pan el sabor ácido proviene del ácido láctico o acético generado durante la fermentación de la masa madre las levaduras candida milleri o saccharomyces exiguus se cultivan en la harina haciendo una especie de simbiosis con la bacteria lactobacillus sanfranciscensis la lactobacillus sanfranciscensis se nombró así por ser un descubrimiento realizado en los pre fermentados elaborados en las panaderías de san francisco estos panes poseen un color en la corteza muy característico un marrón muy pronunciado panes levados por regla general cuando se emplean levaduras para levar la masa se obtienen unos resultados específicos de hinchado del pan pero en algunas culturas no se emplean levaduras y surgen así panes como los de soda muy populares en la culinaria irlandesa o los panes que emplean bacterias de la especie clostridium perfringens o bacillus cereus denominados pan de crecimiento salino pan salt rising estas bacterias son las que generan la gastroenteritis pero tras el proceso de horneado mueren debido a que son sometidas a temperaturas por encima de los c hoy en día se suelen vender masas panaderas congeladas que se introducen directamente en el horno estas masas suelen llevas levaduras químicas como son el pirofosfato ácido de sodio na h p o y el bicarbonato sódico a esta categoría pertenecen los panes rápidos quick breads en inglés como pueden ser el pan de banana los elaborados con crémor tártaro bitartrato de potasio kc h o el cornbread scones o el serbio esnica etc panes planos es muy posible que los panes planos fueran las formas más primigenias de pan y quizás se deba a la facilidad de preparación hoy en día es un pan muy empleado en diferentes culturas de la tierra es por ejemplo muy empleado en las cocinas árabes así como de sur de asia india y pakistán son ejemplos de ello las tortillas americanas una de las características más relevantes de este tipo de panes es la rapidez de preparación en algunos casos se trata tan solo de unos minutos además permite que no exista la necesidad de un gran operativo como fuente de calor se puede emplear una sartén o una simple chapa metálica caliente una piedra o también en las paredes de un horno taboon los panes planos pueden encontrarse en las cocinas occidentales como en la noruega en los flatbr d o los lefse y en la turca en los pide y yufka se puede decir que este tipo de panes se hincha sin necesidad de fermentación muchos de ellos se hacen sin el empleo de levadura debido a que durante su cocción se forman pequeñas burbujas de vapor entre la masa en algunos casos la textura es lo suficientemente robusta como para poder incluir otro alimento este es el caso del pan de pita que permite incluir carne picada en su interior panes sin gluten las personas que padecen trastornos relacionados con el gluten tales como la enfermedad celíaca o la sensibilidad al gluten no celíaca son intolerantes al gluten por esta razón tienen que excluir de forma estricta de la dieta el trigo la cebada el centeno la avena y todas sus especies e híbridos tales como la espelta la escanda el kamut y el triticale la toxicidad de la avena depende del cultivar empleado asimismo frecuentemente presenta contaminación con trigo u otros cereales con gluten con el objetivo de cubrir las necesidades de estas personas actualmente existen panes sin gluten comercializados que se elaboran con harinas alternativas libres de gluten tales como la harina de arroz o la harina de maíz para suplir las propiedades del gluten algunos preparados panificables incluyen goma xantana que proporciona mayor elasticidad al pan y emulsionantes que permiten retener las emisiones de dióxido de carbono de la fermentación otras sustancias utilizadas para proporcionar elasticidad al pan son el agar agar extraído de ciertas algas o la goma garrofín extraída de las semillas del algarrobo panes al vapor fritos en la cocina asiática se suele encontrar este método de aplicar calor a la masa debido bien al uso de vapor caliente bien a una fritura en aceite vegetal a muy alta temperatura un ejemplo es el baozi esta forma de calentar la masa de harina da lugar a un tipo de panes específicos que poseen una corteza con características peculiares la cocina inuit posee un pan frito muy popular denominado bannock un caso particular de la cocina occidental de masa frita es el churro así como las sopaipillas de chile y argentina los panes al vapor son muy típicos en la cocina china baozi en la cocina británica es muy popular el pan al vapor denominado popover elaborado de forma muy similar al yorkshire pudding el mongol buuz el youtiao que posee algunas similitudes al churro el pan de gamba chino en europa se tiene el dampfnudel alemán que es un pan cocido relleno de carne pan rápido el pan rápido es un tipo de pan que se hace crecer con agente leudante en lugar de con levadura la variedad de pan rápido incluye bizcochos y galletas así como pan de banana pan de cerveza cornbread madalenas tortitas scones y pan de soda según la mezcla de agentes leudantes se consiguen panes de textura más o menos turgente o blanda el llamado quick bread se originó muy posiblemente en estados unidos a finales del siglo xviii antes de su creación los productos horneados se hacían crecer con levadura o una mezcla de masa con huevo durante la guerra civil americana la demanda de comida era muy elevada razón por la cual se hacía crecer el pan con baking soda en lugar de levadura pan y salud nutrición el pan se ha considerado desde muy antiguo como uno de los alimentos por excelencia aporta en una cantidad considerable hidratos de carbono de cadena compleja algunas proteínas que pueden llegar a contenidos de g g de pan se trata de proteínas de baja calidad con bajo valor biológico y nutricional debido a que su contenido en aminoácidos no incluye todos los aminoácidos esenciales sino que presenta niveles deficientes del aminoácido esencial lisina se tiene que compensar con la ingesta de otros alimentos como puede ser legumbres posee por regla general pocos contenidos grasos casi siempre ácido oléico y linoléico entre los micronutrientes que posee el pan y algunas trazas de calcio debido al uso de leche que se hace en la elaboración industrial actual hierro es un gran aporte de este mineral selenio potasio fósforo el pan que tiene una harina con germen posee dos vitaminas del grupo b y que son la tiamina que favorece la salud en el sistema nervioso y la niacina que previene la pelagra el pan posee también ácido fólico y una cierta cantidad de carotenoides aunque poca cantidad ya que fueron reducidos durante la fase de mezcla en la elaboración del pan contiene un de agua la pasta cocida llega a un los panes de harinas poco refinadas son las que aportan una mayor cantidad de fibra a la dieta humana no obstante el consumo de pan suele ser una de las fuentes mayoritarias de fibra los panes blancos de harinas refinadas son los que aportan una menor cantidad llegando hasta un el pan denominado como integral puede llegar a tener entre tres a cuatro veces más de fibra el pan ocupa la base de la pirámide alimentaria en la zona de cereales y legumbres lo que indica que puede consumirse al día en una cantidad relativamente moderada comparado con otros alimentos dentro de lo que se considera una dieta equilibrada por ejemplo en la dieta de un niño de un año ya se incluye el pan así como los alimentos de los grupos alimentarios carne verduras y leche existen estudios que mencionan que un consumo de pan de centeno aporta en las mujeres solo un de la proteína un de lípidos y un de carbohidratos necesarios en rdi mientras que en la dieta de un hombre contribuye con un de la proteína un de la grasa y de carbohidratos lo que hace una contribución del total de de los nutrientes recomendados por organización mundial de la salud enfermedades asociadas al consumo de pan a pesar de ser un alimento básico muy antiguo un porcentaje creciente de población en todo el mundo sufre de algún tipo de trastorno relacionado con el gluten que incluyen la enfermedad celíaca la sensibilidad al gluten no celíaca la dermatitis herpetiforme la ataxia por gluten y la alergia al trigo cuyo tratamiento consiste en una dieta libre de gluten estricta por este motivo en recientes años se han lanzado al mercado los panes libres de gluten el incremento del consumo de gluten a nivel mundial los avances en el reconocimiento de la gran cantidad de síntomas afectando a diversos órganos que puede provocar la mejora de los procedimientos diagnósticos y una mayor incidencia real en la población están contribuyendo a un creciente y constante aumento de diagnósticos de estas enfermedades no obstante debido al escaso conocimiento sobre estos trastornos entre los profesionales de la salud que tiende a perpetuarse en la actualidad prácticamente la totalidad de los casos reales continúa sin reconocer sin diagnosticar y sin tratar la mayor parte de los afectados solo presenta síntomas digestivos leves intermitentes o incluso ausentes probablemente debido al efecto opioide del gluten que enmascara el daño intestinal aunque sí desarrollan otros trastornos asociadas que pueden afectar prácticamente a cualquier órgano tras un dilatado historial de variadas molestias de salud y un largo peregrinaje por multitud de consultas de diversos especialistas durante años sin recibir un apoyo médico adecuado la mayoría de las personas afectadas acaba recurriendo a la dieta sin gluten y al autodiagnóstico mientras que otras muchas son personas que se han acostumbrado a vivir con un estado de mala salud crónica como si fuera normal las dietas hipoglucémicas evitan el consumo de pan sobre todo el pan elaborado con harina blanca refinada debido a que posee un alto valor glucémico la adición de leche a algunas masas de pan hace que las personas con intolerancia a la lactosa puedan tener problemas de los panes el más evitado por los nutricionistas es el pan de harina blanca refinada argumentan que las harinas refinadas poseen tal grado de elaboración que gran parte de las propiedades de fibra dietética y de minerales se han perdido en el proceso de refinamiento esta es en cierta medida una de las razones por las que cada vez más se encuentran panes de harinas no refinadas en las panaderías el contenido de ácido fítico en las harinas hace que se disminuya la biodisponibilidad de algunos minerales como el calcio el magnesio el zinc y el fósforo aunque los procesos de elaboración del pan disminuyen en gran medida la cantidad de ácido fítico en la masa los ingredientes empleados en los mejoradores para pan causan cierta alarma entre sectores de la sociedad preocupados por la salud de los alimentos a veces la calidad de los ingredientes añadidos al pan son causa de preocupaciones en el consumidor como es el caso de enzimas aplicados a la elaboración del pan que pueden provocar reacciones de sensibilidad a los mismos en algunos casos los panes no completamente horneados pueden producir en algunas personas flatulencias entre los mejoradores del pan industrial se encuentra el bromato potásico empleado para endurecer las masas prohibido por algunas agencias alimentaria por detectar posibles efectos cancerígenos tendencias modernas del pan las tendencias modernas del pan van por diversas vías una de las más investigadas es la de la fortificación con el objeto de ofrecer a los consumidores un alimento más equilibrado la fortificación puede consistir en incluir elementos minerales vitaminas o incluso por la de aumentar los porcentajes de fibra uno de los objetivos de la industria actual está en cambiar la tendencia decreciente de la demanda ofreciendo un pan más clásico con mejores sabores y aromas otro de los objetivos se centra en una mejora de los procesos de panificación haciendo que sean más efectivos y menos costosos en tiempo dentro de la corriente mundial de reducción del consumo medio de calorías por persona concepto wellness se está pensando panificar con harinas de soja o suero de leche así como reduciendo la cantidad de azúcares en el tema de inventar nuevos ingredientes en la elaboración del pan se tiene el pan de soja una de las tendencias es la disminución progresiva de la sal en las masas a g sodio de g equivalente a g de sal por g uno de los más innovadores procesos de panificación es el que hace la compañía aerated bread company que ofrece pan aireado desde en el que se proclama que la levación de la masa no es debida a la fermentación simple sino al empleo de aire a presión durante etapas anteriores al horneado a pesar de ser la compañía de hace un siglo esta forma de panificación está dando lugar a debates científicos el pan está afectado por las investigaciones realizadas en alimentos modificados genéticamente debido al uso de cereales como trigo o cebada modificada genéticamente estos panes tendrán aparentemente pocas diferencias con respecto a los panes elaborados con harinas tradicionales la ventaja está por parte del cultivador que tiene especies más resistentes dentro de la ingeniería genética se ha logrado cereales con mayor contenido de ácido ascórbico mejora las propiedades mecánicas de la masa cisteína enzimas etc aunque el pan se haga con harinas tradicionales de cereal no modificado cabe la posibilidad de emplear en la levación de las masas levaduras modificadas genéticamente que proporcionen más sabor que procesen los almidones de la harina con mayor eficiencia que respondan a perfiles bajos de temperatura que reaccionen más rápido etc consumo de pan en el mundo el consumo de pan ha ido creciendo durante los siglos acompasado con el ritmo de crecimiento de la población mundial el pan es un alimento barato que

personalidad y características gunn inicialmente tenía un punto de vista muy extremo de la vida es decir todo era blanco o negro bueno o malo no había ningún intermedio y tenía un especial perjuicio hacia los vampiros y demonios esta actitud se suavizó considerablemente durante su tiempo en investigaciones angel aunque a él le gustaba dar la impresión de un brusco solitario gunn valoró su amistad

es,la germinación del latín germinatio nis es el proceso mediante el cual un embrión se desarrolla hasta convertirse en una planta es un proceso que se lleva a cabo cuando el embrión se hincha y la cubierta de la semilla se rompe para lograr esto toda nueva planta requiere de elementos básicos para su desarrollo temperatura agua dióxido de carbono y sales minerales el ejemplo más común de germinación es el brote de un semillero a partir de una semilla de una planta floral o angiosperma sin embargo el crecimiento de una hifa a partir de unas esporas micóticas se considera también germinación en un sentido más general la germinación puede implicar todo lo que se expande en un ser más grande a partir de una existencia pequeña o germen la germinación es un mecanismo de la reproducción sexual de las plantas características la semilla se desarrolla desde un anterozoide situado en el interior del tubo polínico de una flor éste llega al ovario ingresando por la micropila al óvulo donde se produce la fecundación posteriormente el óvulo se transforma en semilla y el ovario en pericarpio o fruto en el desarrollo de la semilla se pueden distinguir tres estados después que se ha efectuado la polinización se llama germinación al proceso por el que se reanuda el crecimiento embrionario después de la fase de descanso este fenómeno no se desencadena hasta que la semilla no ha sido transportada hasta un medio favorable por alguno de los agentes de dispersión las condiciones determinantes del medio son aporte suficiente de agua oxígeno y temperatura apropiada cada especie prefiere para germinar una temperatura determinada en general las condiciones extremas de frío o calor no favorecen la germinación algunas semillas necesitan pasar por un período de dormancia y después de éste también un tiempo determinado de exposición a la luz para iniciar la germinación durante la germinación el agua se difunde a través de las envolturas de la semilla y llega hasta el embrión que durante la fase de descanso se ha secado casi por completo el agua hace que la semilla se hinche a veces hasta el extremo de rasgar la envoltura externa diversas enzimas descomponen los nutrientes almacenados en el endospermo o en los cotiledones en sustancias más sencillas que son transportadas por el interior del embrión hacia los centros de crecimiento el oxígeno absorbido permite a la semilla extraer la energía contenida en estos azúcares de reserva y así poder iniciar el crecimiento la radícula es el primer elemento embrionario en brotar a través de la envoltura de la semilla forma pelos radicales que absorben agua y sujetan el embrión al suelo a continuación empieza a alargarse el hipocótilo que empuja la plúmula y en muchos casos el cotiledón o los cotiledones hacia la superficie del suelo los cotiledones que salen a la luz forman clorofila y llevan a cabo la fotosíntesis hasta que se desarrollan las hojas verdaderas a partir de la plúmula en algunas especies sobre todo de gramíneas los cotiledones no alcanzan nunca la superficie del suelo y la fotosíntesis no comienza hasta que no se desarrollan las hojas verdaderas mientras tanto la planta subsiste a costa de las reservas nutritivas almacenadas en la semilla desde que comienza la germinación hasta que la planta logra la completa independencia de los nutrientes almacenados en la semilla la planta recibe el nombre de plántula requerimientos para que la germinación pueda producirse son necesarios algunos factores externos como un sustrato húmedo suficiente disponibilidad de oxígeno que permita la respiración aerobia y una temperatura adecuada para los distintos procesos metabólicos además la latencia de germinación puede requerir determinados estímulos ambientales como la luz o bajas temperaturas o que se produzca un debilitamiento de las cubiertas seminales también contribuye el clima del lugar en el que se encuentra el cultivo es importante conocer y controlar las plagas que puedan atacar a la futura planta si se va a producir germinados para consumo humano han de tenerse en cuenta factores muy importantes higiene de las semillas agua medio ambiental en el cual van a desarrollarse etapas de la germinación desarrollo del embrión acumulación de reservas alimenticias éstas se fabrican en las partes verdes de la planta y son transportadas a la semilla en desarrollo en las semillas denominadas endospérmicas las reservas alimenticias se depositan fuera del embrión formando el endospermo de la semilla en las semillas llamadas no endospérmicas el material alimenticio es absorbido por el embrión y almacenado en contenedores especiales llamadas cotiledones maduración durante esta fase se seca la semilla y se separa la conexión con la planta madre cortando el suministro de agua y formando un punto de debilidad estructural del que se puede separar fácilmente la semilla madura la mayoría de las semillas entran en un periodo de latencia o inactividad metabólica después de su completa maduración en este periodo la semilla pierde la mayor parte de la humedad que tenía y es precisamente esta sequedad deshidratación el factor principal que garantiza la viabilidad de la semilla y su capacidad para poner fin a la inactividad crecer y convertirse en una nueva planta este periodo de latencia varía de especie a especie algunas semillas mueren rápidamente si se secan demasiado pero existen semillas de mucha antig edad que han germinado después de muchos cientos de años para lograr la germinación la semilla necesita primordialmente agua y dependiendo de la variedad de planta de que se trate puede requerir mayor atención en cuanto a temperatura y condiciones de luz más específicas cada año este ciclo de reproducción se repite de manera invariable sólo se alterará si cambian las condiciones del entorno así si una planta de zona húmeda es cambiada de entorno y clima haciéndolo más seco esta planta se adaptará al cambio o morirá por no tener la capacidad de adaptarse a las nuevas condiciones climáticas teniendo las condiciones mínimas la planta formará las semillas o las esporas el viento o los animales se encargarán de llevarlos a tierras fértiles reiniciando así el ciclo de la vida con la formación de una nueva planta la emergencia de la raíz que inicia el crecimiento de la plántula está desencadenada por la presión de turgencia el crecimiento inicial requiere la utilización de las sustancias de reserva que previamente se habían almacenado en el endospermo o en los cotiledones para ello tiene que haber un proceso de hidrólisis previa y movilización que genere moléculas de pequeño tamaño que puedan ser utilizadas por la plántula en desarrollo la hidrólisis de proteínas está catalizada por diversos tipos de endopeptidasas y exopeptidasas que liberan pequeños péptidos y aminoácidos la movilización de lípidos implica a tres tipos de orgánulos los cuerpos lipídicos los glioxisomas y las mitocondrias las enzimas clave en la metabolización de los lípidos que pueden ser transformados en hexosas son la isocitrato liasa y la malato sintetasa cuyos niveles aumentan notablemente durante la germinación el almidón principal carbohidrato de reserva puede hidrolizarse mediante la acción de amilasas y amilasas o por la almidón fosforilasa liberándose monosacáridos disacáridos y oligosacáridos la movilización de las reservas de fosfato se produce por acción de la fitasa el embrión puede ejercer un control de las distintas actividades enzimáticas mediante la síntesis y liberación de fitohormonas el ejemplo más típico de control hormonal es el de la hidrólisis de almidón por activación de las amilasas mediada por giberelinas en semillas de cereales mientras que las giberelinas y parece ser que también el etileno tienen un claro efecto estimulador de la germinación el ácido abscísico por el contrario inhibe los procesos relacionados con la germinación véase también

es,alcide charles victor marie dessalines d orbigny cou ron loire de septiembre de pierrefitte sur seine de junio de fue un naturalista malacólogo paleontólogo y explorador francés biografía provenía de una familia de médicos especializados en las ciencias naturales antes de cumplir años ya era un naturalista avezado y de prestigio y hasta el famosísimo cuvier lo citaba habitualmente visitó sudamérica enviado por el museo de historia natural de parís en viaje de exploración científica tras dicho viaje d orbigny escribió una obra monumental que constituye un relato histórico referido a uruguay brasil paraguay argentina chile perú y bolivia llegó a montevideo hacia fines de con años de edad para explorar la banda oriental desembarcó en buenos aires en enero de remontó el río paraná hasta corrientes alojándose en rincón de luna itatí goya y el iberá visitó chaco donde observó la nación toba y regresó a buenos aires su interés por la geografía la zoología la botánica y por la situación política y económica nos permite actualmente tener una exacta descripción de aquellos tiempos de regreso a buenos aires a mediados de después de visitar el litoral d orbigny presenció el golpe de juan lavalle contra dorrego posteriormente d orbigny exploró la patagonia y aunque no pudo recorrer personalmente la pampa pidió a un hombre de su confianza narciso parchappe que redactase un informe sobre ella que incluyó en el libro viajó por mar a carmen de patagones donde permaneció ocho meses exploró la boca del río negro la bahía san blas y punta rasa tomó contacto con indios aucas puelches y patagones cuyas costumbres describe en detalle y narra una excursión a las salinas y la caza de ñandúes y de focas llegó seis años antes que darwin a la argentina y descubrió varias centenas de especies de vegetales y de animales como los enigmáticos caracoles ciegos detalló cómo eran los suelos de la provincia de entre ríos y al regresar a su país sufrió el desaire de sus pares que no lo reconocían como paleontólogo y rechazaban su ingreso a la academia de ciencias francesa francia en ese momento estaba destinando naturalistas hacia todo el mundo el museo de historia natural de parís les daba por escrito las instrucciones sobre cómo clasificar y enviar los fósiles u otras piezas de interés por ello d orbigny fue entrenado por varios expertos incluyendo al alemán alexander von humboldt buenos aires ya había sido visitada por el francés amado bonpland y el español félix de azara mientas que a claudio gay se le encomendaría la tarea de explorar chile y fundar el museo nacional de historia natural de ese país el museo más antiguo de sudamérica el mejor antecedente de d orbigny para ser elegido para su misión fue el estudio que había desarrollado sobre los foraminíferos unos seres unicelulares marinos que no miden más de un milímetro por esto se lo considera como el principal fundador de la micropaleontología la existencia de restos fósiles de los tuco tuco o también tucu tucu roedores cavícolas propios de sudamérica del género ctenomys fue descrita por él también se concentró en muchas especies marinas describió el pulpito y la vieira tehuelches así como el mejillón hasta su llegada nadie se había dado cuenta de que ciertos caracoles que viven en aguas argentinas son ciegos y se alimentan de organismos muertos a los que detectan gracias a un complejo sistema sensorial d orbigny los llamó buccinanops en d orbigny volvió a francia y escribió su monumental obra en nueve volúmenes voyage dans l amerique méridionale viaje a la américa meridional una obra que sólo es comparable con los voluminosos escritos de humboldt acerca de la américa equinoccial d orbigny se inicia con una descripción del hombre americano guaraníes araucanos calchaquíes y quechuas su historia y costumbres luego siguen estudios de más de mamíferos pájaros reptiles peces insectos y crustáceos plantas y numerosísimos datos geológicos paleontológicos y etnográficos en cuanto a los estudios paleontológicos por ejemplo d orbigny describió los restos del gliptodonte que había descubierto thomas falkner en y recogió varios fósiles principalmente en las
